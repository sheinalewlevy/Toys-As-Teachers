Walking into the room where her mother and maternal grandparents were sitting, she placed the baby-carrier on the bed and, pulling back the handkerchief, showed the black puppy laced up in the carrier, fast asleep. Everyone laughed because the puppy looked so cunning. The little girl was delighted with him.",Western Apache,NA,YES,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,YES,SILK,Miniature,Composite,Safe,Solitary,Play only
311,2401,6,BOW AND ARROW,Weapons,"The adult world was a world of continual economic activity and angry driving tension. I described the children's relationship in this way:


From this world the children are divided completely by a very simple fact: they own no property. They have neither debtors nor creditors, dog's teeth nor pigs. They haven't a stick of tobacco staked in the transaction. True, the exchange may be made in the name of one of them. Kilipak's father may be paying twelve thousand dog's teeth to his cousin, the father of Kilipak's future wife. This brings the question of Kilipak's one-day marriage before the minds of the other children. They chaff him a little, suddenly stop using his personal name and call him instead ‚Äö√Ñ√∫grandson of Nate,‚Äö√Ñ√π the name of his bride's grandfather. Kilipak turns hot and sullen under their teasing but he takes no extra interest in the ceremony, although in the name of it his elders will some day bring him [Page 111] to account. Today he simply goes off fishing with the other boys.


Afterwards Kilipak will feel this payment in which he takes no interest: henceforth he must avoid his bride's name and the names of all her relatives, and he must lie hidden if his canoe goes through her village. So to the child's eyes, the elders have a great economic show which takes up all their time and attention, makes mother cross and father absentminded, makes the food supply in the house less subject to the child's insistent demands, takes the whole family away from home, or separates him from the large pig which he used to enjoy riding in the water. Then there is a great deal of beating of drums, speech making, and dancing. Every ceremony is just like every other. It may be of huge interest to his elders that for a kinekin feast for a pregnant woman the packs of sago are stacked in threes, while for a pinpuaro feast after birth the sago packs are stood upright. To the elder such important bits of ceremonial procedure are sign and symbol of intimate knowledge, like the inside knowledge on the stock market which the new speculator displays so proudly. But to the child as to the non-investor, this is all so much unintelligible rigmarole.


His version of the whole spectacle is brief and concise. There are two kinds of payments‚Äö√Ñ√Æthe payments made on a grand scale and the small gradual repayments made individually. The big ones may be canoes of sago and pigs and oil, or they may be hundreds of dog's teeth hung up on the islet, in which case there may be dancing. Sometimes, for wholly inexplicable reasons, there is no dancing. At other times a pig changes hands and a drum is beaten about that, most annoyingly. The drum beat may turn one from one's play in anticipation of some interesting event. And it turns out to be nothing but the payment of a debt. Afterwards there are always quarrels, insults, and recriminations. If mother is very much involved in the transaction, so involved that it would be inconvenient to go home‚Äö√Ñ√Æin the children's words, if mother ‚Äö√Ñ√∫has work‚Äö√Ñ√π‚Äö√Ñ√Æfather will be especially nasty to her, knowing she won't dare [Page 112] leave him. But if it's ‚Äö√Ñ√∫father's work,‚Äö√Ñ√π mother is likely to be extra disagreeable, to weary of it in the middle, and go off to her own kin. The fact that a lot of this ‚Äö√Ñ√∫work‚Äö√Ñ√π is ostensibly in his name only serves to set the child more firmly against it, as a most incomprehensible nuisance. To all questions about commerce, the children answer furiously: ‚Äö√Ñ√∫How should we know‚Äö√Ñ√Æwho's grown up here anyway, we or you? What do you think you are to bother us about such things! It's your business, not ours.‚Äö√Ñ√π


The parents permit their children to remain in this happy state of irresponsible inattention. No attempt is made to give the children property and enlist their interest in the financial game. They are simply expected to respect the tabus and avoidances which flow from the economic arrangements, because failure to do so will anger the spirits and produce undesirable results.


In the child's world, property, far from being garnered and stored, is practically communal in use if not in ownership. Property consists of small canoes, paddles, punts, bows and arrows, spears, spider-web nets, strings of beads, occasional bits of tobacco or betel nuts. These last are always shared freely among the children. One poor little cigarette of newspaper and Louisiana twist trade tobacco will pass through fifteen hands before it is returned to its owner for a final farewell puff. If among a group of children one name is heard shouted very frequently above the rest, the listener can be sure that that child has a cigarette which the others are begging. Similarly a string of beads will pass from child to child as a free gift for which no return is expected. Quarrels over property are the rule in the adult world, but they are not frequent among children. The older children imitate their parents' severity and chastise younger children for even touching adults' property, but this is more for a chance to start a fight and from force of habit than from any keen interest in protecting the property.


Quarrels which spring up from other causes will be justified in terms of property, if an adult inquires into them. The children [Page 113] know that to say ‚Äö√Ñ√∫He took my canoe‚Äö√Ñ√π will elicit more sympathy than ‚Äö√Ñ√∫I wanted to make cat's cradles and he didn't‚Äö√Ñ√π; and the child is an adept at translating his world into terms which are acceptable to the adult.


The constant buying and selling, advance and repayment in the adult world is a serious obstacle to any co-operative effort. Individually owned wealth is a continual spur to self-centred individualistic activity. But among the children, where there are no such individual stakes, much more co-operation is seen. The boys of fourteen and fifteen who stand at the head of the group organize the younger children, plan races, on foot or in canoe, organize football teams, the football being a lemon; or institute journeys to the river for a swim. Surface quarrelling and cuffing is fairly frequent, but there is little permanent ill humour. The leadership is too spontaneous, too informal, and has developed no strong devices for coercing the unwilling. The recalcitrant goes home unchastised, the trouble-maker remains. The older boys scold and indulge in vivid vituperation but they dare not use any appreciable force. A real fight between children, even very tiny ones, means a quarrel between their parents, and in any case the child always finds a sympathizer in his parents. Irritation over missped plans or a spoiled game takes itself out, very much as dominoes fall down one upon another. Yesa tells Bopau to get his canoe. Bopau refuses. Yesa slaps him, Tchokal slaps Yesa for slapping Bopau and Kilipak slaps Tchokal for slapping Yesa. Kilipak being the largest in that group, the scuffle degenerates into a few wailing or sulking individuals. In five minutes all is fair weather again unless some child feels so affronted that he goes home to find sympathy. These teapot tempests are frequent and unimportant, the consequence of a large number of aggressive children playing together without devices for control. At that, they are far sunnier and less quarrelsome than their elders, more amenable to leadership, friendlier, less suspicious and more generous. Deep-rooted feuds and antagonisms are absent. Among the elders almost every person has definite antagonisms, always smouldering, always likely [Page 114] to break out into open quarrels. But the size and the varying ages of the children make a fluid unpatterned grouping in which close personal attachments and special antagonisms do not flourish.


Although the parents take violent part for their children, their children do not reciprocate. Children whose parents are making the village ring with abuse, will placidly continue their games in the moonlight. If the quarrels between the parents grow so serious that the spirits may be expected to take a hand, the children are warned against going to the house of the enemy, a prohibition which they may or may not obey.


The whole convention of the child's world is thus a play convention. All participation is volitional and without an arri`re pens‚àö¬©e. But among the adults casual friendliness, neighbourly visiting is regarded as almost reprehensible. Young men without position or standing go to the houses of older relatives to ask for assistance or to render services. Men may haunt their sisters' homes. But visiting between men of the same status, or between married women who are neither sisters nor sisters-in-law, is regarded as trifling, undignified behaviour.",Manus,NA,NO,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Miniature,Composite,Risky,NA,NA

341,849,1,BOW AND ARROW,Weapons,"Only hints of the fundamental elements of Yurok aristocracy are presently available in the literature. An aristocrat was called pe≈í‚â•erk and referred to in English as ‚Äö√Ñ√∫a man‚Äö√Ñ√π or ‚Äö√Ñ√∫a real man‚Äö√Ñ√π (Kroeber 1925:40, 1960:322). A knowledgeable informant of the late 1960s suggested [Page 142] that all such pe≈í‚â•erk had undergone ‚Äö√Ñ√∫training‚Äö√Ñ√π and had ultimately, under sponsorship, gone through a vision experience. For some, this experience occurred in the mountains (Spott and Kroeber 1942:168; Kroeber 1957:205); for others, the vision came while swimming, either in a lake or in whirlpools in the river or ocean (Spott and Kroeber 1942:158‚Äö√Ñ√¨159). Data on these aspects of Yurok aristocracy are frustratingly meager. It seems that an elderly male aristocrat chose for his trainee an intelligent, earnest, and responsible boy of about six. He first taught him how to make a bow, then how to make an arrow, and how to chip stone arrowheads. By the age of about eight, the novice had begun joining his sponsor in his sweathouse. He was taught by his sponsor the details of Yurok law and case precedent over the next decade. His sponsor urged him to learn, not only from him, but also from other pe≈í‚â•erk and women who had undergone special training. The young man went into training, carrying sweathouse firewood, and praying and crying for success in his future. At the age of 16, when his sponsor felt the student's physical strength adequate, the student went through the ‚Äö√Ñ√∫test,‚Äö√Ñ√π in which he survived a lengthly isolation in the high mountains or his swimming feat and returned with a vision. Shortly there-after, he might act as an assistant in a ceremony. Remaining in a ceremonially pure state required sweating and sexual abstinence. Many pe≈í‚â•erk were not active in ceremonial affairs between their teens and middle age. Regular sweating and actively being a pe≈í‚â•erk formerly were synonymous (cf. Spott and Kroeber 1942:168‚Äö√Ñ√¨170).",Yurok,NA,YES,NO,NO,YES,NO,NO,NO,NA,Miniature,Composite,Risky,Social,Instrumental only
1587,1313,4,BOW AND ARROW,Weapons,"Middle period.‚Äö√Ñ√ÆThe following is Neil Buck's account of play when he was a child and later when a big boy. The material represents the period from 1893 to 1903. This, of course, was twenty years after the establishment of the San Carlos Reservation, when reservation life had settled into a groove of its own:


We children used to go to the edge of the river where the willows grew. There we made play wickiups of the willows and pretended to live as older people do. Boys and girls used to get married. Although we didn't exchange gifts such as horses at these marriages, we exchanged food and drink. The boy's family would prepare tulibai. There would be twenty-five mounds of earth piled up in a line, each representing one can of tulibai. The man whose daughter was to be married was invited to bring his family over to drink them. As each can was finished, the mound of earth was obliterated. A little later, the girl's family would prepare a great feast and invite the boy's family over. They had round¬¨‚Ä†[Page 487]¬¨‚Ä†flat pieces of limestone for the dishes and on each would be a different kind of make-believe food. When we got there, they would point out each kind to us, saying, ‚Äö√Ñ√∫This is walnuts; this is acorn meal and stewed meat.‚Äö√Ñ√π


When a boy married, he never married his own sister. We knew about that. But we never thought about clan exogamy, and it didn't matter to us whether two children married who were of the same clan. We didn't pretend that they were of different clans. Also, we boys didn't avoid our own blood sisters, nor they us. We were too young for that. We didn't even pretend to avoid them. We began to think about that much later. We didn't joke our real cross-cousins then, either. We were too young.¬¨‚Ä†24¬¨‚Ä†





A boy had to respect his parents-in-law and avoid his mother-in-law, so his camp was built at a little distance from that of his wife's parents. Though we called each other by our regular names in play when we wanted to, a man couldn't call the names of his parents-in-law, just as it is with grownups. He called them¬¨‚Ä†c‚àö‚Ä†√Ä√¥d‚àö‚Ä†√Ä√¥n‚àö‚â†`¬¨‚Ä†[proper affinal term]. We had brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law whom we called¬¨‚Ä†c‚àö¬®≈í‚â•‚àö‚â†√Ä√¥¬¨‚Ä†[proper affinal term] as well. We used to pretend that a man had obligations to his father-in-law. We had a play store, and he would have to go to the store all the time to buy things for his father-in-law. When we played family, we pretended we had children, but we never pretended that a woman was pregnant or that she gave birth to a baby. We didn't play that the youngest child was the favorite either, as it is among grownups.


I can remember one time when I was a small kid and we were playing family. One girl of the¬¨‚Ä†n‚àö¬∞≈í‚â•‚àö‚â§d‚àö¬Æsg‚àö¬®jn¬¨‚Ä†clan was my mother. There were a lot of other small boys there. We made three or four little piles of dirt, calling them cans of tulibai. When we finished one can, we leveled the pile. Soon we all said we were drunk. I was my mother's only child, so I was alone. The other boys pretended to start a fight with me. They all jumped on me. The girl who was my mother hollered at the top of her lungs as a grown person would do, ‚Äö√Ñ√∫The¬¨‚Ä†'‚àö¬®y‚àö‚Ä†`'‚àö¬∞iy‚Äö√±¬∞¬¨‚Ä†[clan] boys are fighting my son.‚Äö√Ñ√π She shouted so loud that my real mother and older sister back at camp heard her. They used to laugh afterward when they told about it. But we didn't play at having clan blood-feuds. Maybe some children did, but then, you know, not all children play in the same way.





When we played at family and camp life, we did not pretend that one of us was chief and that others were wealthy, influential men, but we¬¨‚Ä†[Page 488]¬¨‚Ä†used to have police. When a man had tulibai, these police sometimes came around and caught him. Then the policeman would dump out the tulibai and arrest the man. The tulibai was muddy water. We had a place we pretended was the guardhouse, and the man would be put in there for three or four days. At this guardhouse food was given to the prisoners. We played at issuing rations also, just as they really did at the agency. The rations were issued to us by our police at the guardhouse. We used to ride to the guardhouse on willow sticks, which we said were horses, to receive our rations. The children would all line up in front of the guardhouse to get their rations. One policeman was detailed to watch the line and prevent any trouble which might arise, just as they really did at the agency, and a second issued the rations to us. We did not play school.


We didn't play at having cattle or burros or dogs, but we did play at horses. One boy would be sent out to drive the horses into camp. He would come in, bringing an armful of willow branches. These were the horses. Ration time would be coming round, so we would need the horses to ride in on to get rations. Men and their wives started off riding. If we had to stop on the way for the night, we tied our horses to a tree. Then we would pull up a few handfuls of grass and leave them there for the horse to eat, just as we had seen our elders do.


We boys also used to make wagons out of tin cans. That was before the railroad came through, and we used to see many teams go by on the way to San Carlos and Globe, hauling freight. They would camp along the road and leave tin cans. We made the wagons of these tin cans. We put the can in a fire and heated it until the solder at both ends melted, and the two round ends came loose. These we made into wheels, punching a hole through the centers for the axle. The rest of the tin we flattened out straight. Then we bent each edge down on the long sides. We punched other holes in the bent-down edges, so we could run sticks through for the axles and attach the wheels. We put two wheels in front and only one in back. Through the sides of the wagon bottom we struck upright poles to hold the loads on, just like a real wagon. Almost every boy had one of these. We used to pretend to haul loads of wood on them, lengths of greasewood about seven inches long. We hauled them to the store to sell to the storekeeper. Sometimes we boys played with the wagons by ourselves without girls, pretending that we were freighting. One boy would go ahead, the others following in a long line along the road, just as we had seen freighters go by. We were hauling to the store. When we played at home where the dogs were, we used to make believe they were horses, and pack loads on them. But the dogs would not follow us away from camp, so we had to use willow branches for horses elsewhere.


After we had been playing family and camps down by the river a¬¨‚Ä†[Page 489]¬¨‚Ä†while, one of the older boys would say he was going to be a white man and run a store. He would make a little inclosure by setting sticks up in the ground. This was the store. Inside, he used sticks to make a sort of shelf to put his goods on. He made things out of mud. These, and stones, were the store goods. The store was always about two hundred yards distant from our camps. When we went to the store to buy things, we used small stones for money. We didn't have any charge accounts.¬¨‚Ä†25


We never played at hunting large game such as deer, but all boys had bows and arrows and used to go out hunting small game. We really did it; we didn't play at it. We did not play at having farms and raising crops,


BOY'S KNIFE


at going out to gather wild seeds and acorns, or at cooking mescal. That was the old way, but we had our store to buy food in. Girls used to cook mud in cans on a fire. That was our food. When we made a fire, we made a very small one because our play wickiups were small. A few boys had those small, old-fashioned matches, but the rest of us had to get our fire at home and carry it down to where we played.


Older boys made knives out of tin cans. Only boys, not girls, did this. The knife was made by bending a piece of tin about the end of a stick, so that it stayed in place. One end of the stick served as a handle. The blade was curved and ground to an edge. The older boys who had these knives always carried them in their pockets, so that if they were out hunting and broke an arrow they could fashion another. They always had a pocketful of all kinds of birds' feathers, as well as sinew, so that they could repair or make new arrows at any time.


Boys, not girls, used to pretend to smoke. We would go along the riverbanks where the water had exposed the dry, pithy root of a cottonwood. We smoked sections of this just like a cigar, and in our store the storekeeper had them for sale. We used to take only a few puffs on them and throw them away. We also dried the leaves of¬¨‚Ä†tc'‚àö‚â†‚âà√át'‚àö‚â§j‚àö¬©`¬¨‚Ä†[‚Äö√Ñ√∫one sucks it‚Äö√Ñ√π (sour dock)] and kept them in a little sack. We rolled cigarettes with these, using the paper from sugar or coffee packages which we picked up at home. Our families did not scold us for doing this. We didn't make ropes to play with. The girls used to make dolls. Little girls made dolls by bundling old rags together and tying them around the middle. Sometimes they made the hair of shredded cloth. We didn't paint our faces, but we used to tattoo marks on our skin‚Äö√Ñ√Æjust marks, not letters. We put them on our wrists, hands, and faces.


[Page 490]


Sometimes we played at having a social dance. We made a little drum out of a tin can. We put some water inside and stretched a piece of cloth across the mouth, tying it there. There would be a whole crowd of children, just like big people gathered at a dance. The boys would sing and sometimes the little girls would sing also. We sang old CJ37's songs, his lightning songs.¬¨‚Ä†26¬¨‚Ä†


Some of the little boys would tell the little girls to go out and start dancing. They would, several of them dancing back and forth together to the music. Then the boys would tell them to dance¬¨‚Ä†‚âà√á‚àö‚Ä†d‚àö‚Ä†tc'‚àö¬®tc'‚àöœÄc¬¨‚Ä†[a type of social dance], and the little girls would pick partners from among the boys to dance with them. Most of these children were from six to eight years old. Older children didn't take part in it. We danced in the daytime, right beside our own homes.


We never played at having a puberty ceremony for a girl, at holding curing ceremonies for sick people, at giving a hunting ceremony, or at singing deer, snake, or other such sacred songs. But we did play at giving the¬¨‚Ä†g‚àö¬∞√Ä√¥n¬¨‚Ä†dance and social dances. One boy called¬¨‚Ä†nd‚àö¬Æ√Ä√¥z‚àö¬©`¬¨‚Ä†[‚Äö√Ñ√∫tall one‚Äö√Ñ√π] was the leader in our community in any play of this sort. I guess he did not wish to play at curing rites or hunting ceremonies, or we might have done it. As he took the initiative in such things, we merely followed him. He was about sixteen at the time all this happened, and I must have been around ten. Some of the other boys were big boys, fourteen and fifteen years old.¬¨‚Ä†nd‚àö¬Æ√Ä√¥z‚àö¬©`¬¨‚Ä†is still living at Fort Apache. He used to pretend he was the father of John Roberson [a famous¬¨‚Ä†g‚àö¬∞√Ä√¥n¬¨‚Ä†shaman at that time] and knew all the¬¨‚Ä†g‚àö¬∞√Ä√¥n¬¨‚Ä†power. He made small¬¨‚Ä†g‚àö¬∞√Ä√¥n¬¨‚Ä†masks for us to wear from the left-over pieces when the men made real¬¨‚Ä†g‚àö¬∞√Ä√¥n¬¨‚Ä†masks for a ceremony. They were of the sotol stalk. We gave these¬¨‚Ä†g‚àö¬∞√Ä√¥n¬¨‚Ä†dances at night. We didn't even pretend to be curing anyone, but just gave them to have the dance.¬¨‚Ä†nd‚àö¬Æ√Ä√¥z‚àö¬©`¬¨‚Ä†himself painted the boys who were going to dance as¬¨‚Ä†g‚àö¬∞√Ä√¥n.¬¨‚Ä†When John Roberson's father used to paint his own dancers, at the end he put a dot of white paint on each of his cheeks and then ran the ends of his fingers dipped in white paint down the backs of his hands in a zigzag. So this boy used to do the same thing. Then he walked out to where we had the fire and called out¬¨‚Ä†h‚àö‚Ä†g‚àö‚à´√Ä√¥, h‚àö‚Ä†g‚àö‚à´√Ä√¥,¬¨‚Ä†just as John Roberson's father did. This was a signal for the impersonators to make their entry.


We used to hold this dance not far from our own homes.¬¨‚Ä†nd‚àö¬Æ√Ä√¥z‚àö¬©`¬¨‚Ä†sang for us. He sang real¬¨‚Ä†g‚àö¬∞√Ä√¥n¬¨‚Ä†songs, ones belonging to this same¬¨‚Ä†g‚àö¬∞√Ä√¥n¬¨‚Ä†shaman which he had picked up from hearing him sing them. He used to have a regular-sized drum made from a large can. He always brought it out when we had a dance. I don't know where he kept it. After the¬¨‚Ä†g‚àö¬∞√Ä√¥n¬¨‚Ä†dance was finished, we would have the circle dance.¬¨‚Ä†27¬¨‚Ä†


After the¬¨‚Ä†[Page 491]¬¨‚Ä†circle dance, we danced¬¨‚Ä†‚âà√á‚àö¬Æd‚àö‚Ä†tc'‚àö¬®tc'‚àöœÄc.¬¨‚Ä†Sometimes it used to turn into a real big dance, older youths and maidens coming down and joining in, helping to carry it through. We younger boys and girls would social dance also. Little girls walked up to a boy and touched him on the shoulder, inviting him to dance, just like grownups. But when only we younger children were playing at it, the dance petered out after a while. We would get tired of it. For the social dancing,¬¨‚Ä†nd‚àö¬Æ√Ä√¥z‚àö¬©`¬¨‚Ä†and some of the rest of us boys sang lightning songs, ones that belonged to the old man, CJ37. He knew we used them, but he didn't seem to mind. When the dance was finished, we put the¬¨‚Ä†g‚àö¬∞√Ä√¥n¬¨‚Ä†masks away in the brush for the night. The next morning we would conceal them where no one could find them, just as a real¬¨‚Ä†g‚àö¬∞√Ä√¥n¬¨‚Ä†shaman would do with his masks. Grownups didn't come to watch these dances of ours. They didn't seem to bother particularly about them, though sometimes our parents would tell us not to do it any more. But you know how kids are. They don't always obey their parents. We kept it up.


John Roberson's father used to give his¬¨‚Ä†g‚àö¬∞√Ä√¥n¬¨‚Ä†dance at almost every girl's puberty ceremony. After the ceremony he put the masks away in a cave across the river, not so far from where we lived. Other shamans who had ceremonial articles to be put away used the same cave. There was a great deal of ceremonial material in this cave.¬¨‚Ä†28¬¨‚Ä†


Sometimes when just we boys were off in the hills during the daytime, without any girls, we would go to this cave, take the masks out, put them on, and pretend to dance. This was under the leadership of¬¨‚Ä†nd‚àö¬Æ√Ä√¥z‚àö¬©`.¬¨‚Ä†But we never touched the hoops or crosses of the lightning shamans which were there. We were afraid of them.¬¨‚Ä†29¬¨‚Ä†


We fooled around with the masks for an hour or so and then put them back and went on our way.¬¨‚Ä†30¬¨‚Ä†





One time, I and some other boys went past this cave.¬¨‚Ä†nd‚àö¬Æ√Ä√¥z‚àö¬©`,¬¨‚Ä†who was with us, said, ‚Äö√Ñ√∫Come on, let's have a dance.‚Äö√Ñ√π We got the masks out, and he put them on us and painted us all up. We made dancing kilts by wrapping our shirts about our waists. Then he told us to wait there, that he was going off a little way, and, when he gave the call and started to sing, to come out and dance. We stood there, waiting. We waited and waited, but he did not call. Finally he took off the masks and went to see what was the matter. He was not there. He had played a joke and run off and left us. Not long after this, John Roberson's father must have found out what we boys had been doing. He must have dreamed about it, for he said, ‚Äö√Ñ√∫Some boy is doing the same way I do.‚Äö√Ñ√π He meant that someone had been using his masks.¬¨‚Ä†[Page 492]¬¨‚Ä†He was angry. But he didn't mind us children making our own small masks and putting on dances at home in which we used his songs. Later on, when¬¨‚Ä†nd‚àö¬Æ√Ä√¥z‚àö¬©`¬¨‚Ä†grew up, this same¬¨‚Ä†g‚àö¬∞√Ä√¥n¬¨‚Ä†shaman used him as a real¬¨‚Ä†g‚àö¬∞√Ä√¥n¬¨‚Ä†dancer. He was a very good one and danced many times, but he never became a¬¨‚Ä†g‚àö¬∞√Ä√¥n¬¨‚Ä†shaman.


There are no children's songs. The only songs that children sing are ones they hear grownups sing. I first started to sing when I was about six or seven. I sang a few songs such as the lightning songs of CJ37, but I only knew parts, not the whole song. I also was able to sing snatches of love songs that I had heard, but I couldn't sing any social dance songs. They were too hard. All of us kids would try to sing parts of such songs as these, but it wasn't until I was about ten that I first really started to learn whole songs. Old CJ37 often sang all night at curing or other ceremonies. He sang lightning songs and medicine songs, as well as others. We boys weren't meant to attend these ceremonies, but we did. The first song I learned to sing was a lightning song. We used to go to the curing ceremonies of CJ13, another shaman. He had all kinds of power for curing sicknesses: snake power, bear power, and others. From hearing these songs sung, we boys learned them. We could not sing the words, but we could sing the choruses. We used to try out one song at our play dances and sing it over and over again until we finally learned it. Then we would learn another and start using it.


We did not play at death and burial. We never did. I don't think it was because we were afraid of it. It was mainly because we never thought about playing that way. Besides, we didn't have the amount of sickness and death then that we have had since.


By the time I was old enough to join in the boys' war game [after eleven or twelve], boys had ceased playing it. But when I was a small boy, not yet old enough to join in, I can remember older boys playing it. Down at Dewey Flats, the Eastern White Mountain camps were on one side of the river, the Western White Mountain camps on the other. The boys from each side played this game against one another. They fought with slings and stones. The Yavapai, camped on the river below us, fought the Arivaipa boys near them in the same way. Big boys and sometimes men took part. Once I was swimming in the river with another small boy. We had no clothes on. A Yavapai youth came along and slung a stone at us. We got up and ran. We tried to throw rocks at him, but missed. We escaped into some thick brush and lay there. He could not see us but slung a stone blindly into the thicket. It hit me right on the buttocks. Years later I met this Yavapai as a man. We talked about that time and laughed.


When I was a boy of ten or so, I used to pretend to play at ‚Äö√Ñ√∫hidden-ball‚Äö√Ñ√π with other boys my age. We didn't play with moccasins but hid¬¨‚Ä†[Page 493]¬¨‚Ä†the ball in the ground. We learned this game from the San Carlos people. We used to go and watch grown men playing it, for they played it not far from the camps. That's how we learned it. After watching a game among the men, boys were likely to start one of their own the next day. We played either during the day or at night, sometimes inside the wickiup. But we just played a little while and then quit. We would bet arrows and marbles with each other. Little girls came and watched us, just like women do at a real game, but they never played. When I was older, I and other boys my age played at hoop-and-poles. But until boys were about fifteen years old they never played this game. It was a man's game. I can remember when I and two friends of mine played it. We had a set of poles made of batamota, and our hoop was of mesquite root. Sometimes, boys made their hoop-and-poles of willow. A boy who owned a set always took it home with him at night after the game, just as a man would do. We had lots of fun playing at this game. There would be a whole lot of boys, just as there were many men about a hoop-and-poles course when they played. We knew exactly how to play it, and our hoops had ‚Äö√Ñ√∫big bead‚Äö√Ñ√π in the middle, with fifty beads, sometimes sixty-one beads, on each side.¬¨‚Ä†31¬¨‚Ä†


We gambled, betting our marbles and tops, but we never pretended to have gambling power for this game. We didn't know about that. Boys weren't allowed to use a real set of hoop-and-poles for fear they would damage them. Just as no women or girls were allowed around when men played hoop-and-poles, we boys didn't let any girls come where we were playing.


Up to ten years old or so boys and girls very often played together, but after eleven or twelve they separated. The sort of play I have told you about [all the preceding, excluding the hoop-and-poles game, the play with the real¬¨‚Ä†g‚àö¬∞√Ä√¥n¬¨‚Ä†masks, and the boy's war game] was mainly girls and boys together. Boys alone didn't play at family, marriage, cooking, making wickiups, or rations. After a boy was eleven or twelve, he spent most of his time going about in groups with other boys, hunting birds and small animals, sometimes all day and even at night, or playing certain boy's games which I will tell you about. Girls played separately from big boys after this age also. Many girls played until they were fifteen or so. They made wickiups just as we did when younger, but these were larger and better made, about six feet high. Inside they played at household with little children, both boys and girls, though these little kids were just there mainly to watch them. That's the way small children learn to play. The big girls would play at cooking. They didn't pretend mud was their food, the way small children do, but they boiled water, pretending it was tulibai and such things. They used to¬¨‚Ä†[Page [facing p.494]]

PLAYING AT COOKING


[Page 494]¬¨‚Ä†make dolls, really good ones, and clothe them in girl's dresses which they sewed. They made the hair of real hair so that it hung down the back. They made miniature moccasins of buckskin for them. They knew how to make good dolls.


We big boys used to hunt kangaroo rats out in the brush at night-time. We didn't eat them. We just killed them. One time a bunch of us boys went across the river from Dewey Flats and killed a whole sackful. There was an old woman living near by who was so old that she was in her second childhood. She spent most of her time asleep. That night we crept into her wickiup and put the sack of rats at the side of her bed as she slept. She slept with the kangaroo rats all night, not knowing it. Next morning I guess she was mad when she found out. Sometimes we boys hunted quail at night. We crossed back and forth across the Gila River as many as two and three times in a night doing this, even in wintertime. I and one of my cross-cousins were out like this one night. We thought we saw a duck in the river. We shot at it. It was just an old stick. We lost our arrow and so we built a fire and made another one by its light. At other times we went up toward Turn-bull Mountain, where there were many cactus plants growing. The quail roosted on these, and we killed them. Sometimes three or four of us would ride burros out into the hills to shoot doves during their nesting season. They were easy to hit when they sat on the nest. When we went out in the hills to hunt, the oldest boy was always the leader. We went where he said. When we killed birds, sometimes we would stop and cook and eat them.


We used to play at renegades and soldiers. CJ30 played with us. He was a lot older than the rest of us. He always used to take the part of Apache Kid, and one other boy always took the part of a Chiricahua renegade. The rest of us were soldiers and scouts and would try to capture these two. There were two hills where we usually played this game. The renegades would come out on the side of one hill and holler at us. Then they would come out on the other side of the hill and shout. We used horse manure as bullets. If you got hit by one of these bullets, you were dead right there. For our captain we had one lame boy. There were boys older than he who could have been captain, but we made him captain because he could not travel fast and was always in the rear.¬¨‚Ä†32¬¨‚Ä†





We always played this game at night. One evening when we were playing we saw a man coming riding toward us. We could see the glint of his rifle barrel in the moonlight. It was only the older brother of Elton Causey coming home from a party, but, thinking it was really Apache Kid, we got scared and all ran off. Our captain was left behind. He hollered at us. Later, the same evening, the oldest¬¨‚Ä†[Page [facing p. 495]]

CHILDREN AT PLAY


[Page 495]¬¨‚Ä†boys among us went up to where some white men, freighting with wagons, had camped for the night. They crept into the camp and stole some biscuits out of a dutch oven. They took a can of salt too. They brought this back to where the rest of us were waiting. We split the biscuits up between us, put salt on them, and ate them. Each one of us got one. This was to feed us soldiers. The white men must have been very sound asleep. The next morning a white man from the camp climbed up on top of a hill where he could overlook our camps. He thought we had taken the biscuits, but he didn't say anything.


One time I, Charley Sago,¬¨‚Ä†nd‚àö¬Æ√Ä√¥z‚àö¬©`,¬¨‚Ä†and some other boys went down river to where the Yavapai were living. We hung about all day. We saw that the Yavapai had a lot of good melons in their fields. We waited until night and then went into the fields and ate our fill of them. We gathered more melons and took them up to where some Mexican freighters were camped on the road. They gave us a meal and some sugar and coffee in exchange for the melons. We left, and after we had gone a little way we could hear the Mexicans commence to shout. We thought that the Yavapai must have found the Mexicans with their melons and that they would soon be on our trail. We ran for it. After a while we heard someone coming on horseback, so we split up. It was too dark to see. When the rider was close, one of the boys hollered, ‚Äö√Ñ√∫Hello.‚Äö√Ñ√π The man answered ‚Äö√Ñ√∫Hello‚Äö√Ñ√π and went on. After going a way farther, we stopped and built a fire to warm ourselves. From there we went to our homes. When I got home, I found mother telling stories with an old woman. That's the way old women used to do. They had cooked up some corn and were eating it. I had some of the coffee and sugar tied in the corner of my shirt. Mother asked me where I got it, and I told her that the Mexicans had given it to me. But I really got it for the melons I had stolen.


I can't remember the children that I played with before I was ten, but from then on, until I went off to school at fourteen, my two best friends were Paul Nosey and Elton Causey. The first died in school.¬¨‚Ä†33¬¨‚Ä†


The second didn't go to school at the same time I did, but not long after that mother told me he went to our camp and lay down on my bed and told her, ‚Äö√Ñ√∫Well, I guess I'll go to school also.‚Äö√Ñ√π He didn't have to go, but he wanted to be with me. The first I knew of it, I saw him there at the school, with his hair already cut like a schoolboy. All three of us were of the same band. We always went about together. Paul was my cross-cousin by clan because his clan was related to that of my father. He was also the son of my mother's half-sister's son. Because of this, our families always camped close together, and that is how I got to know him so well. Elton was of the same clan as Paul and so was also¬¨‚Ä†[Page 496]¬¨‚Ä†my cross-cousin. Whenever we traveled, Elton and his mother used to accompany us, as she was a great friend of my mother's.


Another boy whom I went about with a great deal was the younger brother of Henry Hudson. He was of my father's clan [also a cross-cousin]. There was a boy named Calvin I used to see a lot of. His father's clan and my father's clan were the same, so we were parallel cousins, but I didn't know he was my brother in this way until very much later.¬¨‚Ä†nd‚àö¬Æ√Ä√¥z‚àö¬©`,¬¨‚Ä†the boy who used to be the leader of the¬¨‚Ä†g‚àö¬∞√Ä√¥n¬¨‚Ä†dances, was also a parallel cousin of mine for the same reason. This I did not know until we had grown up. There were other boys we saw, but I saw most of the first four above. There must have been about twenty-five of us boys who played around together. We were of varying ages. We didn't always play together, but often split up to play in small groups because some would want to go one way, some another. Some days there wasn't anything doing at all, and at other times fathers wouldn't let their boys go off to play because they had work for them to do, such as going after the horses. But whenever we played at games such as scouts and renegades, or held a dance, all of us would be there.


24In connection with a child's knowledge of social practices, Neil Buck once remarked, ‚Äö√Ñ√∫As a small boy I heard older people use the expression which signifies that a widow has been reclaimed in marriage by some kinsman of her dead husband. I used to wonder what it meant, and it was several years before I found out.‚Äö√Ñ√π

1004,310,2,POT,Container,"Women and children often fashioned the smaller lamps and pots. The larger ones were the work of the men, although once they were finished and handed over to the housewife they became her exclusive property. No special skill was required; children 10 years of age could make small lamps just as good as those made by their elders. A little more care was necessary in working at a pot, because the rock, though soft, was somewhat brittle, and the walls and bottom had to be comparatively thin; but even this was not beyond the ability of a child, as it required patience rather than technical skill. With his crude copper tools a native could quarry out his block and make the largest lamp that was ever used in about 3 days, and the largest pot in no more than a day longer; iron tools, of course, appreciably lessened the time. First, he chiselled [Page 60] clear of the solid rock a block equal to the length of the desired lamp or pot, then gradually hewed it into shape and smoothed it all over by rubbing it with any kind of hard, smooth stone. Formerly the copper-bladed ice chisel served for quarrying the block, and the copper-headed adze for shaping it, but in more recent times the Eskimo have used hatchets, geological hammers, and chisels with iron blades.",Copper Inuit,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Miniature,Simple,Safe,NA,Instrumental only

That is the way you will make a living.‚Äö√Ñ√π A boy's first prey was usually some small creature such as a bird or lizard. He was taught to shoot by his father or some older person, but he probably learned more about this sort of hunting while with others of his own age on miniature hunting parties when he and his companions set forth armed with slings and small bows and arrows to hunt what they could. By the time boys were twelve, they were hunting quail, rabbits, squirrels, and wood rats, all of which could be used for food. At puberty the average boy was an accurate shot and knew all there was to know about hunting small game.

1793,456,1,BOW AND ARROW,Weapons,"In summer, one may see the family gun standing on its butt, inside the tent tied to one of the sapling stakes to keep it from falling. In winter, particularly in more isolated, smaller camps, one is likely to see a gun standing on its butt in the snow, with some kind of case or rags over it. In winter this is wise; for taking a gun from the relatively warm temperature of a tent to the cold outside, often allows condensation and freezing. This is particularly true of ‚Äö√Ñ√∫repeaters‚Äö√Ñ√π and automatic or semi-automatic weapons. The Indians are well aware of this from long experience, and this fact seems to have something to do with their predilection for single shot rifles. From the time of the early traders these Indians have taken over the rifle. They have, generally speaking, abandoned the use of the bow and arrow, although at times it is still used by adults for bird shooting, both because homemade arrows are cheaper than bullets and because there is relatively no noise in its use, and not as much destruction of the meat as with shells. However, today, the bow, with blunt wooden arrows, serves chiefly as a hunting instrument for young boys, and as a toy for both young and older males. It is still a matter of pride and of conversation among adults when a young boy kills his first game, usually a bird or a squirrel, with his bow and arrow, although there is no ceremony attached to this event. The earlier a boy [Page 122] kills his first game, the better hunter he will be.

1587,1313,11,TOP,Game,"Middle period.‚Äö√Ñ√ÆThe following is Neil Buck's account of play when he was a child and later when a big boy. The material represents the period from 1893 to 1903. This, of course, was twenty years after the establishment of the San Carlos Reservation, when reservation life had settled into a groove of its own:


We children used to go to the edge of the river where the willows grew. There we made play wickiups of the willows and pretended to live as older people do. Boys and girls used to get married. Although we didn't exchange gifts such as horses at these marriages, we exchanged food and drink. The boy's family would prepare tulibai. There would be twenty-five mounds of earth piled up in a line, each representing one can of tulibai. The man whose daughter was to be married was invited to bring his family over to drink them. As each can was finished, the mound of earth was obliterated. A little later, the girl's family would prepare a great feast and invite the boy's family over. They had round¬¨‚Ä†[Page 487]¬¨‚Ä†flat pieces of limestone for the dishes and on each would be a different kind of make-believe food. When we got there, they would point out each kind to us, saying, ‚Äö√Ñ√∫This is walnuts; this is acorn meal and stewed meat.‚Äö√Ñ√π


When a boy married, he never married his own sister. We knew about that. But we never thought about clan exogamy, and it didn't matter to us whether two children married who were of the same clan. We didn't pretend that they were of different clans. Also, we boys didn't avoid our own blood sisters, nor they us. We were too young for that. We didn't even pretend to avoid them. We began to think about that much later. We didn't joke our real cross-cousins then, either. We were too young.¬¨‚Ä†24¬¨‚Ä†


24In connection with a child's knowledge of social practices, Neil Buck once remarked, ‚Äö√Ñ√∫As a small boy I heard older people use the expression which signifies that a widow has been reclaimed in marriage by some kinsman of her dead husband. I used to wonder what it meant, and it was several years before I found out.‚Äö√Ñ√π


A boy had to respect his parents-in-law and avoid his mother-in-law, so his camp was built at a little distance from that of his wife's parents. Though we called each other by our regular names in play when we wanted to, a man couldn't call the names of his parents-in-law, just as it is with grownups. He called them¬¨‚Ä†c‚àö‚Ä†√Ä√¥d‚àö‚Ä†√Ä√¥n‚àö‚â†`¬¨‚Ä†[proper affinal term]. We had brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law whom we called¬¨‚Ä†c‚àö¬®≈í‚â•‚àö‚â†√Ä√¥¬¨‚Ä†[proper affinal term] as well. We used to pretend that a man had obligations to his father-in-law. We had a play store, and he would have to go to the store all the time to buy things for his father-in-law. When we played family, we pretended we had children, but we never pretended that a woman was pregnant or that she gave birth to a baby. We didn't play that the youngest child was the favorite either, as it is among grownups.


I can remember one time when I was a small kid and we were playing family. One girl of the¬¨‚Ä†n‚àö¬∞≈í‚â•‚àö‚â§d‚àö¬Æsg‚àö¬®jn¬¨‚Ä†clan was my mother. There were a lot of other small boys there. We made three or four little piles of dirt, calling them cans of tulibai. When we finished one can, we leveled the pile. Soon we all said we were drunk. I was my mother's only child, so I was alone. The other boys pretended to start a fight with me. They all jumped on me. The girl who was my mother hollered at the top of her lungs as a grown person would do, ‚Äö√Ñ√∫The¬¨‚Ä†'‚àö¬®y‚àö‚Ä†`'‚àö¬∞iy‚Äö√±¬∞¬¨‚Ä†[clan] boys are fighting my son.‚Äö√Ñ√π She shouted so loud that my real mother and older sister back at camp heard her. They used to laugh afterward when they told about it. But we didn't play at having clan blood-feuds. Maybe some children did, but then, you know, not all children play in the same way.


When we played at family and camp life, we did not pretend that one of us was chief and that others were wealthy, influential men, but we¬¨‚Ä†[Page 488]¬¨‚Ä†used to have police. When a man had tulibai, these police sometimes came around and caught him. Then the policeman would dump out the tulibai and arrest the man. The tulibai was muddy water. We had a place we pretended was the guardhouse, and the man would be put in there for three or four days. At this guardhouse food was given to the prisoners. We played at issuing rations also, just as they really did at the agency. The rations were issued to us by our police at the guardhouse. We used to ride to the guardhouse on willow sticks, which we said were horses, to receive our rations. The children would all line up in front of the guardhouse to get their rations. One policeman was detailed to watch the line and prevent any trouble which might arise, just as they really did at the agency, and a second issued the rations to us. We did not play school.


We didn't play at having cattle or burros or dogs, but we did play at horses. One boy would be sent out to drive the horses into camp. He would come in, bringing an armful of willow branches. These were the horses. Ration time would be coming round, so we would need the horses to ride in on to get rations. Men and their wives started off riding. If we had to stop on the way for the night, we tied our horses to a tree. Then we would pull up a few handfuls of grass and leave them there for the horse to eat, just as we had seen our elders do.


We boys also used to make wagons out of tin cans. That was before the railroad came through, and we used to see many teams go by on the way to San Carlos and Globe, hauling freight. They would camp along the road and leave tin cans. We made the wagons of these tin cans. We put the can in a fire and heated it until the solder at both ends melted, and the two round ends came loose. These we made into wheels, punching a hole through the centers for the axle. The rest of the tin we flattened out straight. Then we bent each edge down on the long sides. We punched other holes in the bent-down edges, so we could run sticks through for the axles and attach the wheels. We put two wheels in front and only one in back. Through the sides of the wagon bottom we struck upright poles to hold the loads on, just like a real wagon. Almost every boy had one of these. We used to pretend to haul loads of wood on them, lengths of greasewood about seven inches long. We hauled them to the store to sell to the storekeeper. Sometimes we boys played with the wagons by ourselves without girls, pretending that we were freighting. One boy would go ahead, the others following in a long line along the road, just as we had seen freighters go by. We were hauling to the store. When we played at home where the dogs were, we used to make believe they were horses, and pack loads on them. But the dogs would not follow us away from camp, so we had to use willow branches for horses elsewhere.


After we had been playing family and camps down by the river a¬¨‚Ä†[Page 489]¬¨‚Ä†while, one of the older boys would say he was going to be a white man and run a store. He would make a little inclosure by setting sticks up in the ground. This was the store. Inside, he used sticks to make a sort of shelf to put his goods on. He made things out of mud. These, and stones, were the store goods. The store was always about two hundred yards distant from our camps. When we went to the store to buy things, we used small stones for money. We didn't have any charge accounts.¬¨‚Ä†25


25¬¨‚Ä†Notice that the store is at a distance from the camp, just as it should be. Charge accounts are now the most common way of doing business, although they were less common in former times.


We never played at hunting large game such as deer, but all boys had bows and arrows and used to go out hunting small game. We really did it; we didn't play at it. We did not play at having farms and raising crops,





at going out to gather wild seeds and acorns, or at cooking mescal. That was the old way, but we had our store to buy food in. Girls used to cook mud in cans on a fire. That was our food. When we made a fire, we made a very small one because our play wickiups were small. A few boys had those small, old-fashioned matches, but the rest of us had to get our fire at home and carry it down to where we played.


Older boys made knives out of tin cans. Only boys, not girls, did this. The knife was made by bending a piece of tin about the end of a stick, so that it stayed in place. One end of the stick served as a handle. The blade was curved and ground to an edge. The older boys who had these knives always carried them in their pockets, so that if they were out hunting and broke an arrow they could fashion another. They always had a pocketful of all kinds of birds' feathers, as well as sinew, so that they could repair or make new arrows at any time.


Boys, not girls, used to pretend to smoke. We would go along the riverbanks where the water had exposed the dry, pithy root of a cottonwood. We smoked sections of this just like a cigar, and in our store the storekeeper had them for sale. We used to take only a few puffs on them and throw them away. We also dried the leaves of¬¨‚Ä†tc'‚àö‚â†‚âà√át'‚àö‚â§j‚àö¬©`¬¨‚Ä†[‚Äö√Ñ√∫one sucks it‚Äö√Ñ√π (sour dock)] and kept them in a little sack. We rolled cigarettes with these, using the paper from sugar or coffee packages which we picked up at home. Our families did not scold us for doing this. We didn't make ropes to play with. The girls used to make dolls. Little girls made dolls by bundling old rags together and tying them around the middle. Sometimes they made the hair of shredded cloth. We didn't paint our faces, but we used to tattoo marks on our skin‚Äö√Ñ√Æjust marks, not letters. We put them on our wrists, hands, and faces.


[Page 490]


Sometimes we played at having a social dance. We made a little drum out of a tin can. We put some water inside and stretched a piece of cloth across the mouth, tying it there. There would be a whole crowd of children, just like big people gathered at a dance. The boys would sing and sometimes the little girls would sing also. We sang old CJ37's songs, his lightning songs.¬¨‚Ä†26¬¨‚Ä†


26¬¨‚Ä†CJ37 was a very powerful lightning shaman in the community.


Some of the little boys would tell the little girls to go out and start dancing. They would, several of them dancing back and forth together to the music. Then the boys would tell them to dance¬¨‚Ä†‚âà√á‚àö‚Ä†d‚àö‚Ä†tc'‚àö¬®tc'‚àöœÄc¬¨‚Ä†[a type of social dance], and the little girls would pick partners from among the boys to dance with them. Most of these children were from six to eight years old. Older children didn't take part in it. We danced in the daytime, right beside our own homes.


We never played at having a puberty ceremony for a girl, at holding curing ceremonies for sick people, at giving a hunting ceremony, or at singing deer, snake, or other such sacred songs. But we did play at giving the¬¨‚Ä†g‚àö¬∞√Ä√¥n¬¨‚Ä†dance and social dances. One boy called¬¨‚Ä†nd‚àö¬Æ√Ä√¥z‚àö¬©`¬¨‚Ä†[‚Äö√Ñ√∫tall one‚Äö√Ñ√π] was the leader in our community in any play of this sort. I guess he did not wish to play at curing rites or hunting ceremonies, or we might have done it. As he took the initiative in such things, we merely followed him. He was about sixteen at the time all this happened, and I must have been around ten. Some of the other boys were big boys, fourteen and fifteen years old.¬¨‚Ä†nd‚àö¬Æ√Ä√¥z‚àö¬©`¬¨‚Ä†is still living at Fort Apache. He used to pretend he was the father of John Roberson [a famous¬¨‚Ä†g‚àö¬∞√Ä√¥n¬¨‚Ä†shaman at that time] and knew all the¬¨‚Ä†g‚àö¬∞√Ä√¥n¬¨‚Ä†power. He made small¬¨‚Ä†g‚àö¬∞√Ä√¥n¬¨‚Ä†masks for us to wear from the left-over pieces when the men made real¬¨‚Ä†g‚àö¬∞√Ä√¥n¬¨‚Ä†masks for a ceremony. They were of the sotol stalk. We gave these¬¨‚Ä†g‚àö¬∞√Ä√¥n¬¨‚Ä†dances at night. We didn't even pretend to be curing anyone, but just gave them to have the dance.¬¨‚Ä†nd‚àö¬Æ√Ä√¥z‚àö¬©`¬¨‚Ä†himself painted the boys who were going to dance as¬¨‚Ä†g‚àö¬∞√Ä√¥n.¬¨‚Ä†When John Roberson's father used to paint his own dancers, at the end he put a dot of white paint on each of his cheeks and then ran the ends of his fingers dipped in white paint down the backs of his hands in a zigzag. So this boy used to do the same thing. Then he walked out to where we had the fire and called out¬¨‚Ä†h‚àö‚Ä†g‚àö‚à´√Ä√¥, h‚àö‚Ä†g‚àö‚à´√Ä√¥,¬¨‚Ä†just as John Roberson's father did. This was a signal for the impersonators to make their entry.


We used to hold this dance not far from our own homes.¬¨‚Ä†nd‚àö¬Æ√Ä√¥z‚àö¬©`¬¨‚Ä†sang for us. He sang real¬¨‚Ä†g‚àö¬∞√Ä√¥n¬¨‚Ä†songs, ones belonging to this same¬¨‚Ä†g‚àö¬∞√Ä√¥n¬¨‚Ä†shaman which he had picked up from hearing him sing them. He used to have a regular-sized drum made from a large can. He always brought it out when we had a dance. I don't know where he kept it. After the¬¨‚Ä†g‚àö¬∞√Ä√¥n¬¨‚Ä†dance was finished, we would have the circle dance.¬¨‚Ä†27¬¨‚Ä†


27¬¨‚Ä†This customarily follows the completion of the¬¨‚Ä†g‚àö¬∞√Ä√¥n¬¨‚Ä†dance.


After the¬¨‚Ä†[Page 491]¬¨‚Ä†circle dance, we danced¬¨‚Ä†‚âà√á‚àö¬Æd‚àö‚Ä†tc'‚àö¬®tc'‚àöœÄc.¬¨‚Ä†Sometimes it used to turn into a real big dance, older youths and maidens coming down and joining in, helping to carry it through. We younger boys and girls would social dance also. Little girls walked up to a boy and touched him on the shoulder, inviting him to dance, just like grownups. But when only we younger children were playing at it, the dance petered out after a while. We would get tired of it. For the social dancing,¬¨‚Ä†nd‚àö¬Æ√Ä√¥z‚àö¬©`¬¨‚Ä†and some of the rest of us boys sang lightning songs, ones that belonged to the old man, CJ37. He knew we used them, but he didn't seem to mind. When the dance was finished, we put the¬¨‚Ä†g‚àö¬∞√Ä√¥n¬¨‚Ä†masks away in the brush for the night. The next morning we would conceal them where no one could find them, just as a real¬¨‚Ä†g‚àö¬∞√Ä√¥n¬¨‚Ä†shaman would do with his masks. Grownups didn't come to watch these dances of ours. They didn't seem to bother particularly about them, though sometimes our parents would tell us not to do it any more. But you know how kids are. They don't always obey their parents. We kept it up.


John Roberson's father used to give his¬¨‚Ä†g‚àö¬∞√Ä√¥n¬¨‚Ä†dance at almost every girl's puberty ceremony. After the ceremony he put the masks away in a cave across the river, not so far from where we lived. Other shamans who had ceremonial articles to be put away used the same cave. There was a great deal of ceremonial material in this cave.¬¨‚Ä†28¬¨‚Ä†


28¬¨‚Ä†Such ceremonial objects, once put away, are never used again. It would be very dangerous to disturb them.


Sometimes when just we boys were off in the hills during the daytime, without any girls, we would go to this cave, take the masks out, put them on, and pretend to dance. This was under the leadership of¬¨‚Ä†nd‚àö¬Æ√Ä√¥z‚àö¬©`.¬¨‚Ä†But we never touched the hoops or crosses of the lightning shamans which were there. We were afraid of them.¬¨‚Ä†29¬¨‚Ä†


29¬¨‚Ä†Lightning is the most dreaded of all supernatural forces.


We fooled around with the masks for an hour or so and then put them back and went on our way.¬¨‚Ä†30¬¨‚Ä†


30¬¨‚Ä†The same thing was recorded for aboriginal times.


One time, I and some other boys went past this cave.¬¨‚Ä†nd‚àö¬Æ√Ä√¥z‚àö¬©`,¬¨‚Ä†who was with us, said, ‚Äö√Ñ√∫Come on, let's have a dance.‚Äö√Ñ√π We got the masks out, and he put them on us and painted us all up. We made dancing kilts by wrapping our shirts about our waists. Then he told us to wait there, that he was going off a little way, and, when he gave the call and started to sing, to come out and dance. We stood there, waiting. We waited and waited, but he did not call. Finally he took off the masks and went to see what was the matter. He was not there. He had played a joke and run off and left us. Not long after this, John Roberson's father must have found out what we boys had been doing. He must have dreamed about it, for he said, ‚Äö√Ñ√∫Some boy is doing the same way I do.‚Äö√Ñ√π He meant that someone had been using his masks.¬¨‚Ä†[Page 492]¬¨‚Ä†He was angry. But he didn't mind us children making our own small masks and putting on dances at home in which we used his songs. Later on, when¬¨‚Ä†nd‚àö¬Æ√Ä√¥z‚àö¬©`¬¨‚Ä†grew up, this same¬¨‚Ä†g‚àö¬∞√Ä√¥n¬¨‚Ä†shaman used him as a real¬¨‚Ä†g‚àö¬∞√Ä√¥n¬¨‚Ä†dancer. He was a very good one and danced many times, but he never became a¬¨‚Ä†g‚àö¬∞√Ä√¥n¬¨‚Ä†shaman.


There are no children's songs. The only songs that children sing are ones they hear grownups sing. I first started to sing when I was about six or seven. I sang a few songs such as the lightning songs of CJ37, but I only knew parts, not the whole song. I also was able to sing snatches of love songs that I had heard, but I couldn't sing any social dance songs. They were too hard. All of us kids would try to sing parts of such songs as these, but it wasn't until I was about ten that I first really started to learn whole songs. Old CJ37 often sang all night at curing or other ceremonies. He sang lightning songs and medicine songs, as well as others. We boys weren't meant to attend these ceremonies, but we did. The first song I learned to sing was a lightning song. We used to go to the curing ceremonies of CJ13, another shaman. He had all kinds of power for curing sicknesses: snake power, bear power, and others. From hearing these songs sung, we boys learned them. We could not sing the words, but we could sing the choruses. We used to try out one song at our play dances and sing it over and over again until we finally learned it. Then we would learn another and start using it.


We did not play at death and burial. We never did. I don't think it was because we were afraid of it. It was mainly because we never thought about playing that way. Besides, we didn't have the amount of sickness and death then that we have had since.


By the time I was old enough to join in the boys' war game [after eleven or twelve], boys had ceased playing it. But when I was a small boy, not yet old enough to join in, I can remember older boys playing it. Down at Dewey Flats, the Eastern White Mountain camps were on one side of the river, the Western White Mountain camps on the other. The boys from each side played this game against one another. They fought with slings and stones. The Yavapai, camped on the river below us, fought the Arivaipa boys near them in the same way. Big boys and sometimes men took part. Once I was swimming in the river with another small boy. We had no clothes on. A Yavapai youth came along and slung a stone at us. We got up and ran. We tried to throw rocks at him, but missed. We escaped into some thick brush and lay there. He could not see us but slung a stone blindly into the thicket. It hit me right on the buttocks. Years later I met this Yavapai as a man. We talked about that time and laughed.


When I was a boy of ten or so, I used to pretend to play at ‚Äö√Ñ√∫hidden-ball‚Äö√Ñ√π with other boys my age. We didn't play with moccasins but hid¬¨‚Ä†[Page 493]¬¨‚Ä†the ball in the ground. We learned this game from the San Carlos people. We used to go and watch grown men playing it, for they played it not far from the camps. That's how we learned it. After watching a game among the men, boys were likely to start one of their own the next day. We played either during the day or at night, sometimes inside the wickiup. But we just played a little while and then quit. We would bet arrows and marbles with each other. Little girls came and watched us, just like women do at a real game, but they never played. When I was older, I and other boys my age played at hoop-and-poles. But until boys were about fifteen years old they never played this game. It was a man's game. I can remember when I and two friends of mine played it. We had a set of poles made of batamota, and our hoop was of mesquite root. Sometimes, boys made their hoop-and-poles of willow. A boy who owned a set always took it home with him at night after the game, just as a man would do. We had lots of fun playing at this game. There would be a whole lot of boys, just as there were many men about a hoop-and-poles course when they played. We knew exactly how to play it, and our hoops had ‚Äö√Ñ√∫big bead‚Äö√Ñ√π in the middle, with fifty beads, sometimes sixty-one beads, on each side.¬¨‚Ä†31¬¨‚Ä†


31¬¨‚Ä†Beads are the coils about a cord tied across the diameter of the hoop. They are used in scoring.


We gambled, betting our marbles and tops, but we never pretended to have gambling power for this game. We didn't know about that. Boys weren't allowed to use a real set of hoop-and-poles for fear they would damage them. Just as no women or girls were allowed around when men played hoop-and-poles, we boys didn't let any girls come where we were playing.


Up to ten years old or so boys and girls very often played together, but after eleven or twelve they separated. The sort of play I have told you about [all the preceding, excluding the hoop-and-poles game, the play with the real¬¨‚Ä†g‚àö¬∞√Ä√¥n¬¨‚Ä†masks, and the boy's war game] was mainly girls and boys together. Boys alone didn't play at family, marriage, cooking, making wickiups, or rations. After a boy was eleven or twelve, he spent most of his time going about in groups with other boys, hunting birds and small animals, sometimes all day and even at night, or playing certain boy's games which I will tell you about. Girls played separately from big boys after this age also. Many girls played until they were fifteen or so. They made wickiups just as we did when younger, but these were larger and better made, about six feet high. Inside they played at household with little children, both boys and girls, though these little kids were just there mainly to watch them. That's the way small children learn to play. The big girls would play at cooking. They didn't pretend mud was their food, the way small children do, but they boiled water, pretending it was tulibai and such things. They used to¬¨‚Ä†[Page [facing p.494]]





[Page 494]¬¨‚Ä†make dolls, really good ones, and clothe them in girl's dresses which they sewed. They made the hair of real hair so that it hung down the back. They made miniature moccasins of buckskin for them. They knew how to make good dolls.


We big boys used to hunt kangaroo rats out in the brush at night-time. We didn't eat them. We just killed them. One time a bunch of us boys went across the river from Dewey Flats and killed a whole sackful. There was an old woman living near by who was so old that she was in her second childhood. She spent most of her time asleep. That night we crept into her wickiup and put the sack of rats at the side of her bed as she slept. She slept with the kangaroo rats all night, not knowing it. Next morning I guess she was mad when she found out. Sometimes we boys hunted quail at night. We crossed back and forth across the Gila River as many as two and three times in a night doing this, even in wintertime. I and one of my cross-cousins were out like this one night. We thought we saw a duck in the river. We shot at it. It was just an old stick. We lost our arrow and so we built a fire and made another one by its light. At other times we went up toward Turn-bull Mountain, where there were many cactus plants growing. The quail roosted on these, and we killed them. Sometimes three or four of us would ride burros out into the hills to shoot doves during their nesting season. They were easy to hit when they sat on the nest. When we went out in the hills to hunt, the oldest boy was always the leader. We went where he said. When we killed birds, sometimes we would stop and cook and eat them.


We used to play at renegades and soldiers. CJ30 played with us. He was a lot older than the rest of us. He always used to take the part of Apache Kid, and one other boy always took the part of a Chiricahua renegade. The rest of us were soldiers and scouts and would try to capture these two. There were two hills where we usually played this game. The renegades would come out on the side of one hill and holler at us. Then they would come out on the other side of the hill and shout. We used horse manure as bullets. If you got hit by one of these bullets, you were dead right there. For our captain we had one lame boy. There were boys older than he who could have been captain, but we made him captain because he could not travel fast and was always in the rear.¬¨‚Ä†32¬¨‚Ä†


32¬¨‚Ä†Old scouts often speak of how their white officers were unable to keep up with them on foot during campaigns against hostile Apache.


We always played this game at night. One evening when we were playing we saw a man coming riding toward us. We could see the glint of his rifle barrel in the moonlight. It was only the older brother of Elton Causey coming home from a party, but, thinking it was really Apache Kid, we got scared and all ran off. Our captain was left behind. He hollered at us. Later, the same evening, the oldest¬¨‚Ä†[Page [facing p. 495]]





[Page 495]¬¨‚Ä†boys among us went up to where some white men, freighting with wagons, had camped for the night. They crept into the camp and stole some biscuits out of a dutch oven. They took a can of salt too. They brought this back to where the rest of us were waiting. We split the biscuits up between us, put salt on them, and ate them. Each one of us got one. This was to feed us soldiers. The white men must have been very sound asleep. The next morning a white man from the camp climbed up on top of a hill where he could overlook our camps. He thought we had taken the biscuits, but he didn't say anything.


One time I, Charley Sago,¬¨‚Ä†nd‚àö¬Æ√Ä√¥z‚àö¬©`,¬¨‚Ä†and some other boys went down river to where the Yavapai were living. We hung about all day. We saw that the Yavapai had a lot of good melons in their fields. We waited until night and then went into the fields and ate our fill of them. We gathered more melons and took them up to where some Mexican freighters were camped on the road. They gave us a meal and some sugar and coffee in exchange for the melons. We left, and after we had gone a little way we could hear the Mexicans commence to shout. We thought that the Yavapai must have found the Mexicans with their melons and that they would soon be on our trail. We ran for it. After a while we heard someone coming on horseback, so we split up. It was too dark to see. When the rider was close, one of the boys hollered, ‚Äö√Ñ√∫Hello.‚Äö√Ñ√π The man answered ‚Äö√Ñ√∫Hello‚Äö√Ñ√π and went on. After going a way farther, we stopped and built a fire to warm ourselves. From there we went to our homes. When I got home, I found mother telling stories with an old woman. That's the way old women used to do. They had cooked up some corn and were eating it. I had some of the coffee and sugar tied in the corner of my shirt. Mother asked me where I got it, and I told her that the Mexicans had given it to me. But I really got it for the melons I had stolen.


I can't remember the children that I played with before I was ten, but from then on, until I went off to school at fourteen, my two best friends were Paul Nosey and Elton Causey. The first died in school.¬¨‚Ä†33¬¨‚Ä†


33¬¨‚Ä†The second boy mentioned was not a close friend of the narrator's in adult life.


The second didn't go to school at the same time I did, but not long after that mother told me he went to our camp and lay down on my bed and told her, ‚Äö√Ñ√∫Well, I guess I'll go to school also.‚Äö√Ñ√π He didn't have to go, but he wanted to be with me. The first I knew of it, I saw him there at the school, with his hair already cut like a schoolboy. All three of us were of the same band. We always went about together. Paul was my cross-cousin by clan because his clan was related to that of my father. He was also the son of my mother's half-sister's son. Because of this, our families always camped close together, and that is how I got to know him so well. Elton was of the same clan as Paul and so was also¬¨‚Ä†[Page 496]¬¨‚Ä†my cross-cousin. Whenever we traveled, Elton and his mother used to accompany us, as she was a great friend of my mother's.


Another boy whom I went about with a great deal was the younger brother of Henry Hudson. He was of my father's clan [also a cross-cousin]. There was a boy named Calvin I used to see a lot of. His father's clan and my father's clan were the same, so we were parallel cousins, but I didn't know he was my brother in this way until very much later.¬¨‚Ä†nd‚àö¬Æ√Ä√¥z‚àö¬©`,¬¨‚Ä†the boy who used to be the leader of the¬¨‚Ä†g‚àö¬∞√Ä√¥n¬¨‚Ä†dances, was also a parallel cousin of mine for the same reason. This I did not know until we had grown up. There were other boys we saw, but I saw most of the first four above. There must have been about twenty-five of us boys who played around together. We were of varying ages. We didn't always play together, but often split up to play in small groups because some would want to go one way, some another. Some days there wasn't anything doing at all, and at other times fathers wouldn't let their boys go off to play because they had work for them to do, such as going after the horses. But whenever we played at games such as scouts and renegades, or held a dance, all of us would be there.",Western Apache,NA,NO,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Child-only,NA,Safe,Social,NA
162,2198,2,BOOT CRIMPER,Instrument,"Apart from intangible dangers, children may cause some realistic annoyance to their parents by their selection of playthings. For instance, a child may borrow one of the family's large wood urine bowls and use it as a toboggan in which to slide down a snow-covered hill. This is a delightful pastime no doubt for the child, but it also opens up the bottom of the bowl which ruins it for use as a storage for liquids. The family reaction may be imagined with a touch of tolerance added. Also, children cut themselves with great regularity playing with tools purloined from their mothers‚Äö√Ñ√¥ sewing bags.

At this age, one already notices among them a greater reserve: it is difficult to find boys and girls together during the bath or at play. The girls stay home with the women or in the square, playing among themselves, helping the mother or sisters in the domestic chores. The boys get together in a happy society, chasing small animals, hunting with a small bow and arrow made by the father or by them themselves. They, however, continue to belong to the society of the women; excluded from that of the men and 171 prohibited from attending certain ceremonies and rites and entering the men's house ( baemanagueggeu ), as is also prohibited for the women.

1284,2102,1,FIGURE (DOG),Animal Figure,"The Gilyak children, like all children, enjoy imitating and mimicking in their games the activities; work, and amusements of parents and adults. One of the earliest, most common, and most popular games of Gilyak children is the moving back and forth of wooden figures which are supposed to represent dogs. It is noteworthy that these figures, which do not remotely resemble a dog, are quite stereotyped among the Gilyak (see Pl. LX, Fig. 6 /see p. 1260/) and only now and then vary in size. Whether they are made by the parents or by older brothers of the little ones, a copy of the shape of a dog is obviously never intended in producing them. The legs of the animal, for instance, are not in the least even indicated ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ rather it is simply the conventionally assumed representation of a dog as a toy. Or could it perhaps be, as one might almost suspect from its general usage among the Gilyak, a fragment of an old conventional picture language among them?

LX, Fig. 5 /see p. 1260/), bear a quite different character, because they reveal an attempt to give a really similar picture of the animal. As soon as the boys are able to romp about freely, they amuse themselves by shooting with small bows and arrows at a target or at imaginary animals, by traveling on small sleds with the whelps, or by faithfully imitating all the manipulations that they see the adults execute with bears, for which one boy represents the bear and behaves like it, but the others try to pull it, subdue it and lead it away, etc., precisely as is done during the processions with the animal at the bear festivals. Very soon they are also taken along by the father or older brother to set up or inspect the animal traps in the woods, for fishing, and the like, and they learn from them the pertinent techniques and in general what to do or to avoid.

The fragments of the cones left by squirrels and chipmunks were gathered and pulverized into a fine powder. Backfat and marrow were added and the mixture allowed to cool until it was solid. Then it was distributed as a confection during social gatherings and meetings. It was an aid to digestion as well as a delicacy.


Acer glabrum


The dry, crushed leaves were used to spice stored meat.


Achillea millefolium


A pleasant tea was made from the leaves and flowers.


Allium spp.


A few bulbs were used to spice soup made of wheat and marrow.


Amelanchier alnifolia


The saskatoon berry was a staple food. Its most common use was in the preparation of pemmican, a mixture of animal fat, dried meat, and the crushed berry. The berries could also be combined with an equal amount of fat and stuffed into a portion of intestine which was tied at both ends and boiled, later to be eaten like a sausage. Saskatoon and Red Osier Dogwood (Cornus stolonifera) berries were a favorite snack reserved for men. Saskatoons were sometimes crushed with flour in preparation for winter storage.


For food reserves, the berries were dried on a raised hide that had numerous holes punctured in it. The hide was kept four or five feet from the ground to discourage children and animals from eating the berries. When it was dry, the choice of the harvest was greased with backfat and stored [Page 101] in hide bags made of fetal deer of sheep. That way the berries would not spoil. Then they would be added to soups or made into sausages.


Saskatoon leaves were crushed and mixed with blood, then dried and used to make a rich broth in winter.


The Blackfoot distinguished differences among river, coulee (cutbank) and mountain saskatoons and preferred the taste of the coulee one.


Arctostaphylos uva-ursi


The tart berries were washed and eaten or dried and soaked later with sugar.


The leaves could be crushed and smoked with tobacco or brewed for tea.

Runners chewed the leaves for their mentholating properties.


Artemisia frigida


The crushed leaves were mixed with stored meat to maintain a good odor.


Artemisia ludoviciana


The leaves were chewed as a confection.


Asclepias viridiflora


In the spring the plant was used to spice soups. The fresh root was often eaten and pieces saved for winter soups.


Astragalus canadensis


The root, known as ‚Äö√Ñ√∫Tender Root‚Äö√Ñ√π, was another staple and was either eaten fresh or boiled in blood or broth. Sometimes the roots were obtained by robbing the burrow of a small, mouse-like mammal.


Berberis repens


On rare occasions the berry was eaten when nothing else was available.


Cammassia quamash


The bulbs were boiled and given in soup on special events. The [Page 102] Blackfoot always obtained them from the Kootenay and called them ‚Äö√Ñ√∫excrements‚Äö√Ñ√π, the same name for candy.


Cirsium spp.


The flower head was dissected and the pedicel eaten fresh.


Cornus stolonifera


The cambium of the dogwood was dried, greased and crushed, then mixed with smoking tobacco.


The ripe berries were eaten.


Crataegus chrysocarpa


Certain conditions had to be met before the berries were eaten. Otherwise, they would cause stomach cramps. The procedure was to offer the tree a gift, for boys a little bow and arrow made from the thorns, for girls a pair of miniature moccasins fashioned from the leaves. In return, the tree would not allow its berries to ‚Äö√Ñ√∫bite‚Äö√Ñ√π the stomach. The gifts were placed on the tree and the berries collected.


Disporum trachycarpum


The ripe berries of the ‚Äö√Ñ√∫dog-foot‚Äö√Ñ√π were eaten anytime.


Elaeagnus commutata


The berries were peeled and eaten or mixed with grease and stored in a cool place, then eaten as a confection or added to soups and broths.

Erythronium grandiflorum


See Lilium philadelphicum


Fritillaria pudica


See Lilium philadelphicum


[Page 103]


Geranium viscosissimum


The leaves, which are quite pungent, were kept in food storage bags in order to mask the spoiling of their contents.


Heracleum lanatum


The stem of the young plant was peeled and eaten like celery. Women cut the stem into small pieces which were dipped in blood and stored until their use in soup and broths.


Lilium philadelphicum


As with Erythronium and Fritillaria, the bulb was eaten fresh or with soup. The bulb of this plant (and by association the other two) is referred to as ‚Äö√Ñ√∫bee‚Äö√Ñ√¥s tooth‚Äö√Ñ√π because it breaks into small, rice-like kernals when it is rubbed, imaginary bee teeth.


Lomatium triternatum


The flowers of ‚Äö√Ñ√∫stands alone‚Äö√Ñ√π or ‚Äö√Ñ√∫many standing‚Äö√Ñ√π were sometimes mixed with pemmican.


Mammilaria vivipara


The fruits of these ‚Äö√Ñ√∫wild figs‚Äö√Ñ√π were eaten as a confection.


Mentha arvensis


The plant was bound in bunches, dried and used to make a delicious tea of spice pemmican and soups.


Osmorhiza occidentalis


The root of ‚Äö√Ñ√∫smell mouth‚Äö√Ñ√π, which is quite sweet, was chewed as a confection, especially during the winter.


Perideridia gairdneri


The roots of ‚Äö√Ñ√∫double turnip‚Äö√Ñ√π, another staple, were eaten fresh or saved for use in soups, etc. Children often made snacks of them while playing on the prairie.


[Page 104]


Physaria didymocarpa


A person who had not eaten for a long time would drink a decoction of the plant slowly. This would expand his stomach gradually until he could eat a normal amount without pain.


Pinus contorta


The pitch was chewed like gum.


Populus tremuloides


The cambium of aspen was eaten. Children especially would snack on it. Anyone observing a liquid taboo was allowed to suck a piece of the bark.


Potentilla fruticosa


The leaves were mixed with dried meat as a deodorant and spice.


Prunus virginiana


Women collected the ripe berries, another staple, and divided them into those to be preserved whole and those to be crushed. The ones for storage were greased and dried in the sun, then put away in the fawn-skin bags. The others were crushed on a stone and mixed with backfat for pemmican or added to soups, etc. The juice from the crushing was given as a special drink to husbands or the favorite child.


Choke-cherry sticks were gathered, stripped of their bark and inserted into raosting meat for spice.


Psoralea esculenta


Women dug the root with choke-cherry sticks. Then it was either peeled and eaten fresh or dried and added to winter supplies.


Ribes oxyacanthoides


‚Äö√Ñ√∫Punctured berries‚Äö√Ñ√π, a wild currant, were eaten fresh or added to soups, etc. They were not saved for winter use.


[Page 105]


Rosa spp.


Rose hips, termed ‚Äö√Ñ√∫wild tomatoes‚Äö√Ñ√π, could be crushed and added to pemmican.


Rubus parviflorus


The ripe fruit of this ‚Äö√Ñ√∫red berry tasts‚Äö√Ñ√π was eaten.


Salix spp.


The cambium was scraped and eaten, especially by children. The galls on some river willows were peeled and eaten and were said to be quite tasty.


Selaginella densa


A starving man would not eat the plant because it had a doping effect, making one feel unusually strong. For this apparent effect, the plant was called ‚Äö√Ñ√∫feels chest‚Äö√Ñ√π. The plant was also dried and used to spice meat. ‚Äö√Ñ√∫Namanokchi‚Äö√Ñ√π (Shepherdia argentea?)


The berries, which were very bitter, were eaten only through necessity and never stored.


Shepherdia candensis


Even though they were bitter, the berries were eaten in lean times.


Thalictrum occidentalis


The fruit of ‚Äö√Ñ√∫Gros Ventre smell‚Äö√Ñ√π were used to spice pemmican, dried meat and broths.


Veratrum viride


The young leaves of ‚Äö√Ñ√∫bitter tastes‚Äö√Ñ√π or ‚Äö√Ñ√∫blue leaves‚Äö√Ñ√π were added to soups. Children were given the leaves to chew and they would stop their drooling.

headbands [II.G.3.b.(1)]. The last time the novices sing (Plate 41 c), these headbands are collected and the tail feathers (Plate 41 d) given to the Pr‚àö‚â•-kh‚àö¬£mm‚àö¬£. The Pr‚àö‚â•-kh‚àö¬£mm‚àö¬£ choose a novice for excellence in the festival performance to whom they award the right to wear the warbonnet. This youth's naming-uncle is then summoned and given the feathers to make the bonnet. The headband strap and the tassel at the end are made of cotton. If the bonnet is made on time, the runner with the ceremonial lance will wear it while he runs the gauntlet of padded arrows [II.F.2.c.(3)] on the last morning of the Kh‚àö‚Ñ¢‚àö‚Ñ¢t‚àö‚à´way‚àö‚Ñ¢ festival.

For a few mornings in the early winter, when the first ice had formed at the edge of the water, children were made to take a dip in a frigid stream; this was thought to provide lifelong protection against colds. At or before puberty, boys were made to feel unwanted and driven out of the house, in hopes that some supernatural being would take pity on them when alone in the woods and give them power, with which to perform some useful occupation in life. Such beings could also appear spontaneously to lost or troubled children and adults, and hence an individual could have power from several visions. In the early twentieth century, conservative Munsees still isolated a girl at her first menses, though in a darkened room rather than a hut. Partial menstrual isolation was also practiced by some Oklahoma Delaware women, in particular by cooking over a separate fire and eating alone. There is a tradition that when the Delaware lived in villages a single large house was built at a distance for all the menstruating women of the community to use together.

Whether they are made by the parents or by older brothers of the little ones, a copy of the shape of a dog is obviously never intended in producing them. The legs of the animal, for instance, are not in the least even indicated ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ rather it is simply the conventionally assumed representation of a dog as a toy.

Very soon they are also taken along by the father or older brother to set up or inspect the animal traps in the woods, for fishing, and the like, and they learn from them the pertinent techniques and in general what to do or to avoid.

Kilipak turns hot and sullen under their teasing but he takes no extra interest in the ceremony, although in the name of it his elders will some day bring him [Page 111] to account. Today he simply goes off fishing with the other boys.


Afterwards Kilipak will feel this payment in which he takes no interest: henceforth he must avoid his bride's name and the names of all her relatives, and he must lie hidden if his canoe goes through her village. So to the child's eyes, the elders have a great economic show which takes up all their time and attention, makes mother cross and father absentminded, makes the food supply in the house less subject to the child's insistent demands, takes the whole family away from home, or separates him from the large pig which he used to enjoy riding in the water. Then there is a great deal of beating of drums, speech making, and dancing. Every ceremony is just like every other. It may be of huge interest to his elders that for a kinekin feast for a pregnant woman the packs of sago are stacked in threes, while for a pinpuaro feast after birth the sago packs are stood upright. To the elder such important bits of ceremonial procedure are sign and symbol of intimate knowledge, like the inside knowledge on the stock market which the new speculator displays so proudly. But to the child as to the non-investor, this is all so much unintelligible rigmarole.


His version of the whole spectacle is brief and concise. There are two kinds of payments‚Äö√Ñ√Æthe payments made on a grand scale and the small gradual repayments made individually. The big ones may be canoes of sago and pigs and oil, or they may be hundreds of dog's teeth hung up on the islet, in which case there may be dancing. Sometimes, for wholly inexplicable reasons, there is no dancing. At other times a pig changes hands and a drum is beaten about that, most annoyingly. The drum beat may turn one from one's play in anticipation of some interesting event. And it turns out to be nothing but the payment of a debt. Afterwards there are always quarrels, insults, and recriminations. If mother is very much involved in the transaction, so involved that it would be inconvenient to go home‚Äö√Ñ√Æin the children's words, if mother ‚Äö√Ñ√∫has work‚Äö√Ñ√π‚Äö√Ñ√Æfather will be especially nasty to her, knowing she won't dare [Page 112] leave him. But if it's ‚Äö√Ñ√∫father's work,‚Äö√Ñ√π mother is likely to be extra disagreeable, to weary of it in the middle, and go off to her own kin. The fact that a lot of this ‚Äö√Ñ√∫work‚Äö√Ñ√π is ostensibly in his name only serves to set the child more firmly against it, as a most incomprehensible nuisance. To all questions about commerce, the children answer furiously: ‚Äö√Ñ√∫How should we know‚Äö√Ñ√Æwho's grown up here anyway, we or you? What do you think you are to bother us about such things! It's your business, not ours.‚Äö√Ñ√π


The parents permit their children to remain in this happy state of irresponsible inattention. No attempt is made to give the children property and enlist their interest in the financial game. They are simply expected to respect the tabus and avoidances which flow from the economic arrangements, because failure to do so will anger the spirits and produce undesirable results.


In the child's world, property, far from being garnered and stored, is practically communal in use if not in ownership. Property consists of small canoes, paddles, punts, bows and arrows, spears, spider-web nets, strings of beads, occasional bits of tobacco or betel nuts. These last are always shared freely among the children. One poor little cigarette of newspaper and Louisiana twist trade tobacco will pass through fifteen hands before it is returned to its owner for a final farewell puff. If among a group of children one name is heard shouted very frequently above the rest, the listener can be sure that that child has a cigarette which the others are begging. Similarly a string of beads will pass from child to child as a free gift for which no return is expected. Quarrels over property are the rule in the adult world, but they are not frequent among children. The older children imitate their parents' severity and chastise younger children for even touching adults' property, but this is more for a chance to start a fight and from force of habit than from any keen interest in protecting the property.


Quarrels which spring up from other causes will be justified in terms of property, if an adult inquires into them. The children [Page 113] know that to say ‚Äö√Ñ√∫He took my canoe‚Äö√Ñ√π will elicit more sympathy than ‚Äö√Ñ√∫I wanted to make cat's cradles and he didn't‚Äö√Ñ√π; and the child is an adept at translating his world into terms which are acceptable to the adult.


The constant buying and selling, advance and repayment in the adult world is a serious obstacle to any co-operative effort. Individually owned wealth is a continual spur to self-centred individualistic activity. But among the children, where there are no such individual stakes, much more co-operation is seen. The boys of fourteen and fifteen who stand at the head of the group organize the younger children, plan races, on foot or in canoe, organize football teams, the football being a lemon; or institute journeys to the river for a swim. Surface quarrelling and cuffing is fairly frequent, but there is little permanent ill humour. The leadership is too spontaneous, too informal, and has developed no strong devices for coercing the unwilling. The recalcitrant goes home unchastised, the trouble-maker remains. The older boys scold and indulge in vivid vituperation but they dare not use any appreciable force. A real fight between children, even very tiny ones, means a quarrel between their parents, and in any case the child always finds a sympathizer in his parents. Irritation over missped plans or a spoiled game takes itself out, very much as dominoes fall down one upon another. Yesa tells Bopau to get his canoe. Bopau refuses. Yesa slaps him, Tchokal slaps Yesa for slapping Bopau and Kilipak slaps Tchokal for slapping Yesa. Kilipak being the largest in that group, the scuffle degenerates into a few wailing or sulking individuals. In five minutes all is fair weather again unless some child feels so affronted that he goes home to find sympathy. These teapot tempests are frequent and unimportant, the consequence of a large number of aggressive children playing together without devices for control. At that, they are far sunnier and less quarrelsome than their elders, more amenable to leadership, friendlier, less suspicious and more generous. Deep-rooted feuds and antagonisms are absent. Among the elders almost every person has definite antagonisms, always smouldering, always likely [Page 114] to break out into open quarrels. But the size and the varying ages of the children make a fluid unpatterned grouping in which close personal attachments and special antagonisms do not flourish.


Although the parents take violent part for their children, their children do not reciprocate. Children whose parents are making the village ring with abuse, will placidly continue their games in the moonlight. If the quarrels between the parents grow so serious that the spirits may be expected to take a hand, the children are warned against going to the house of the enemy, a prohibition which they may or may not obey.


The whole convention of the child's world is thus a play convention. All participation is volitional and without an arri`re pens‚àö¬©e. But among the adults casual friendliness, neighbourly visiting is regarded as almost reprehensible. Young men without position or standing go to the houses of older relatives to ask for assistance or to render services. Men may haunt their sisters' homes. But visiting between men of the same status, or between married women who are neither sisters nor sisters-in-law, is regarded as trifling, undignified behaviour.",Manus,NA,NO,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Child-only,NA,Safe,NA,NA

One of the earliest, most common, and most popular games of Gilyak children is the moving back and forth of wooden figures which are supposed to represent dogs. It is noteworthy that these figures, which do not remotely resemble a dog, are quite stereotyped among the Gilyak (see Pl. LX, Fig. 6 /see p. 1260/) and only now and then vary in size. Whether they are made by the parents or by older brothers of the little ones, a copy of the shape of a dog is obviously never intended in producing them. The legs of the animal, for instance, are not in the least even indicated ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ rather it is simply the conventionally assumed representation of a dog as a toy. Or could it perhaps be, as one might almost suspect from its general usage among the Gilyak, a fragment of an old conventional picture language among them? Other animal figures allegedly likewise carved for the delight [Page 1050] 645 cont. and entertainment of the children, for instance, those of the carp (Gilyak pilengat, Pl. LX, Fig. 5 /see p. 1260/), bear a quite different character, because they reveal an attempt to give a really similar picture of the animal. As soon as the boys are able to romp about freely, they amuse themselves by shooting with small bows and arrows at a target or at imaginary animals, by traveling on small sleds with the whelps, or by faithfully imitating all the manipulations that they see the adults execute with bears, for which one boy represents the bear and behaves like it, but the others try to pull it, subdue it and lead it away, etc., precisely as is done during the processions with the animal at the bear festivals. Very soon they are also taken along by the father or older brother to set up or inspect the animal traps in the woods, for fishing, and the like, and they learn from them the pertinent techniques and in general what to do or to avoid.

Sometimes a lad with more ingenuity than the rest would carve out a pretty model of a canoe from a cedar stick; and I have seen boys, with little canoes which they had made, scarce three feet long, fearlessly paddle about the water in these little cockles, which seemed ready at any moment to sink.


Sometimes the boys would catch a lot of minnows, and then the girls would join them, and, having made a little fire and a miniature rack for smoking fish, would imitate the manner of curing salmon, which, when done, were served up as a repast.
