A small boy of three or four, seeing another riding, would ask to be put on the horse himself. His father or some other relative lifted him up on a gentle horse and, if safe, turned it loose to let him try and ride by himself. But he was not allowed out of sight: ‚ÄúA small boy up on top of a horse seems so tiny that they joke about it and call him dj√≤Àô≈Ç√© [wild gourd], because he looks just like a little [Page 474] round ball. He keeps thumping his heels against the horse's ribs, trying to make him go. It looks funny because his legs are so short that he kicks the horse more than halfway up the sides.‚Äù It was a manly desire for a little boy to wish to ride, and one which his father was proud to encourage. Women did far less riding than men, and consequently girls did not often start riding before seven or eight years old. A little boy at this age might be good enough to ride off alone if he had a gentle horse or burro, but he was not considered expert until twelve or thirteen. Children were never instructed in riding. Being raised where riding was commonplace, they learned it by experience and by watching others. Girls and boys started saddling and bridling almost as soon as they were tall and strong enough to lift the saddle onto the horse's back (about nine or ten years old). Sometimes, when a boy had difficulty saddling, he tried to lift the saddle by placing it on his head and thus shoving it up onto the horse. If he was still unable to do it, one of his parents or some other older person helped him. Because of such difficulties, burros were favorite mounts for children. The child was not shown how a saddle should be put on but was merely cautioned to cinch it up well so that it would not fall off.",NA,NA,https://ehrafworldcultures.yale.edu/sres/e20b2080-d8c8-4f4e-99dd-74dd9276af9d,33.86,-110.12,1942,5580,Play,Single

Vedder believes that the engravings of game tracks indicate old boundaries, as do the stone heaps which are usually designated as Heiseb graves. In any case the question arises as to who actually established these boundaries. My informants stated unanimously that the division stems from the time when the Bushmen still had a supreme chief. There seems to be some authority, however, even today, since in the bush veld the boundary lines are drawn with reference to certain trees, which, in general do not have too long a life. The Bushmen move back and forth within their hunting territories. It sometimes happens that a young hunter is not thoroughly familiar with the boundaries or that wounded game crosses the boundary. In this case the hunter must [Page 59] 32 cont. go to the kin group to whom this territory belongs and take the men to the animal. Then it will be carefully divided down the middle; the hunter gets one half, and the owners get the other half. Nevertheless, quarrels are common, because there is only one of certain organs, such as the heart, liver, etc. These conditions, however, exist only among the eastern !Kung. A Hei//om or a northern !Kung who is found hunting in the territory of another tribe is regarded as an enemy. Boys' hunting is confined to lizards, tree rats, and other rodents. They ordinarily use the bird arrow, which is carved out of a piece of wood, but in contrast to the Ovambo, the older boys here already have poisoned arrows. Young and old pursue the hunting of birds with great enthusiasm; in particular guinea fowl, sand hens, grouse, and the Pau /?/ insofar as it occurs in this region. These fowl and small bushbucks are the chief sources of the meat in the native diet. The forest region of the eastern !Kung is poor in large game. Zebras are almost entirely absent, as is the wildebeest; the giraffe is very rare. The eland, kudu, hartebeest, and especially the gemsbok are relatively more common. Hunting drives are organized to hunt the elephant or rhinoceros. First, the elephant is separated from the herd. As soon as it has been cornered, one Bushman after another springs forward and throws his spear. It is also possible to hunt the elephant with poisoned arrows; there is a number of thinner spots in the skin at the front legs, and the marksman places as many arrows there as possible. The elephant does not die; it merely becomes sick. The hunter rushes home to get some other men, who then go to look for the elephant with spears. Pitfalls are made in the vicinity of the watering places, and a pointed pole is placed inside them. The Bushmen along the Okovanggo also hunt the hippopotamus with pitfalls. The eastern !Kung maintain that in ancient times the hippopotamus was also found in their land. The sling trap is made in various sizes. The ostrich in particular is usually caught in such sling traps, which are provided with a piece of bone bleached by the sun. Small cats and the like are also caught with this trap. It is likewise placed on the trails of the bushbuck. Jackals and the like are caught by lying in wait for them as they come out of their dens and then beating them to death with the kirri.",NA,NA,https://ehrafworldcultures.yale.edu/sres/828609b6-2478-432a-af6a-cf5b0e066c27,-19.83,20.58,1934,6655,Use,Single

The most common types of baskets made by the Warao are as follows:


a) The cylindrical-conical basket or ‚Äúmapire‚Äù, with convex, circular base, woven according to three techniques: 1) Superimposed layers¬†uhumuta¬†(Fig. 9):¬†C¬†two layers or fibers are crossed diagonally, one over the other, without interweaving, and each of the elements of one layer is joined to those of the other by means of a third, horizontal element which runs through the entire basket in a spiral (Leroi-Gourhan, 1943); 2) Six-pointed hexagonal or star¬†uharahara¬†(Fig. 10):¬†D¬†two layers of fibers are superimposed crossing each other diagonally and the elements of a third, horizontal layer pass over all the elements of one of the diagonal layers and beneath those of the other, forming hexagons and assuring the cohesion of the basket; 3) Variation of the hexagonal or three-pointed star basket weaving¬†waramara¬†(Fig. 11):¬†E¬†[Page 42].The whole process may take six or eight weeks. The Warao also make, following the same weaving technique, small one-piece hammocks which, supported on the mother's neck, are used to carry children on the hip (Plate 21).¬†[Page 43]. [Page 45]¬†51 cont.¬†in this case there is added to the previous weaving a fourth element which runs down the middle of each row of hexagons, dividing them in halves.


The cylindrico-conical baskets have diagonal supports interwoven within them from the¬†inflection to the binding off. This letter, in the shape of a hoop, draws together all the elements of the weaving. A fiber of ‚Äútirite‚Äù wound into a spiral holds it in place. A pair of braided handles made of moriche fiber, or cords, are fixed to the base and rise loosely as far as the inflection, where they are introduced into the basket, brought out again, follow the outer basket surface and the free ends are tied. The initial portion of the basket is knotted-radial, in the type which is made of superimposed layers and plain-woven in the hexagonal type and its variant (Belfet, 1952).


These baskets are used both by men and by women for carrying moriche palm products, various foods and personal objects slung across their backs. They are also hung from the roof rafters and are used to keep personal belongings in.


b) The circular¬†bihi¬†sieve (Fig. 12) is woven with a textile technique: two groups of fibers are placed in horizontal and vertical positions respectively, and the elements of the weft are passed over and then under the warp elements. In this way a tight weave is achieved, decorated with a great variety of¬†[Page 47A]¬†[Page 48]¬†55 cont.¬†geometric designs, the form of which depend on the number of intercrossed elements and the variation in colors resulting from the alternation of the matte and glossy sides of the ‚Äútirite‚Äù fibers. The supports are intertwined in the center to form a cross. The mouth is composed of two superimposed hoops¬†which act as a press and between which the trimmed ends of the horizontal and vertical elements of the weaving are introduced. A fiber of ‚Äútirite‚Äù is wrapped in spiral fashion about the hoop, holding it in place, and is introduced into the weaving at regular intervals. When applying the insertion technique a pair of deer antlers are used as awls.


This basket may be used as a container of food products for immediate use on the kitchen floor, but its specific function is in the straining and kneading of flour from the pith of the moriche palm (page¬†65)¬†57/Ill. appears here/


c) The¬†aru-huba¬†‚Äúsebuc√°n‚Äù (cassava snake) or cylindrical press for bitter cassava (¬†Manihot utilissima) (Fig. 13), in textile weave, is made up of three parts: 1) The¬†[Page 49]¬†57 cont. loop or upper section, woven on a diagonal, is a strap which crowns at its top end the mouth or entrance for the mass of cassava which is to be pressed; 2) The body, also woven on a diagonal, is made up of fibers joined in pairs, which are woven by alternating the matte and glossy sides in a checker board design; 3) The handle or base which is formed by the prolongation of the elements of the weaving. A tie¬†58¬†[Page 50]¬†[Page 52]¬†60¬†of the same ‚Äútirite‚Äù fiber binds them and gives them rigidity. This press is used for the extraction of hydrocyanic acid contained in the bitter cassava (page¬†75);


d) The quadrangular¬†manari¬†sieve (Fig. 14)¬†A¬†is made with a textile weave. The elements of the weft pass over two, under three and then over and under two elements of the warp, in a straight, slightly open weave. In order to bind off, the elements of the weaving are wrapped around two superimposed slim canes and are immediately inserted into the woven surface. The ends of the canes, bound with moriche fiber, stick out slightly from the corners. This sieve is used in sifting the pressed, dry mass of bitter cassava. (page¬†75).


e) The¬†berei¬†fish basket (Fig. 15),¬†B¬†circular in shape, in hexagonal weave, is used to collect the small fish which congregate in the ‚Äúca√±itos‚Äù [creeks] at low tide.


f) The¬†moriki¬†child's rattle, used to entertain small children, comes in two types: cylindrical, woven in diagonal according to textile weave and is finished off at its lower end by a handle in which all the free elements of the weaving are brought together and tied with moriche fiber.

The Warao: natives of the Orinoco Delta",RATTLE,Music,Comp,Low,ChildOnly,YES,NO,NO,NO,NO,NO,YES,FIBERS,NA,NA,NA,Unknown,NA,NA,NA,NA,South America,Hunter-gatherers,"The weaving of baskets is an activity performed mostly by women (Plate 22),¬†A¬†however men weave ‚Äúsebucanes‚Äù or bitter cassava (¬†Manihot utilissima) cylinder presses, sieves and lidded hanging baskets. ‚ÄúTirite‚Äù reeds (¬†Ischnosiphon arouma), separated into fibers (Plates 23, 24),¬†B¬†supply the raw material. The most common types of baskets made by the Warao are as follows:


a) The cylindrical-conical basket or ‚Äúmapire‚Äù, with convex, circular base, woven according to three techniques: 1) Superimposed layers¬†uhumuta¬†(Fig. 9):¬†C¬†two layers or fibers are crossed diagonally, one over the other, without interweaving, and each of the elements of one layer is joined to those of the other by means of a third, horizontal element which runs through the entire basket in a spiral (Leroi-Gourhan, 1943); 2) Six-pointed hexagonal or star¬†uharahara¬†(Fig. 10):¬†D¬†two layers of fibers are superimposed crossing each other diagonally and the elements of a third, horizontal layer pass over all the elements of one of the diagonal layers and beneath those of the other, forming hexagons and assuring the cohesion of the basket; 3) Variation of the hexagonal or three-pointed star basket weaving¬†waramara¬†(Fig. 11):¬†E¬†[Page 42].The whole process may take six or eight weeks. The Warao also make, following the same weaving technique, small one-piece hammocks which, supported on the mother's neck, are used to carry children on the hip (Plate 21).¬†[Page 43]. [Page 45]¬†51 cont.¬†in this case there is added to the previous weaving a fourth element which runs down the middle of each row of hexagons, dividing them in halves.


The cylindrico-conical baskets have diagonal supports interwoven within them from the¬†inflection to the binding off. This letter, in the shape of a hoop, draws together all the elements of the weaving. A fiber of ‚Äútirite‚Äù wound into a spiral holds it in place. A pair of braided handles made of moriche fiber, or cords, are fixed to the base and rise loosely as far as the inflection, where they are introduced into the basket, brought out again, follow the outer basket surface and the free ends are tied. The initial portion of the basket is knotted-radial, in the type which is made of superimposed layers and plain-woven in the hexagonal type and its variant (Belfet, 1952).


These baskets are used both by men and by women for carrying moriche palm products, various foods and personal objects slung across their backs. They are also hung from the roof rafters and are used to keep personal belongings in.


b) The circular¬†bihi¬†sieve (Fig. 12) is woven with a textile technique: two groups of fibers are placed in horizontal and vertical positions respectively, and the elements of the weft are passed over and then under the warp elements. In this way a tight weave is achieved, decorated with a great variety of¬†[Page 47A]¬†[Page 48]¬†55 cont.¬†geometric designs, the form of which depend on the number of intercrossed elements and the variation in colors resulting from the alternation of the matte and glossy sides of the ‚Äútirite‚Äù fibers. The supports are intertwined in the center to form a cross. The mouth is composed of two superimposed hoops¬†which act as a press and between which the trimmed ends of the horizontal and vertical elements of the weaving are introduced. A fiber of ‚Äútirite‚Äù is wrapped in spiral fashion about the hoop, holding it in place, and is introduced into the weaving at regular intervals. When applying the insertion technique a pair of deer antlers are used as awls.


This basket may be used as a container of food products for immediate use on the kitchen floor, but its specific function is in the straining and kneading of flour from the pith of the moriche palm (page¬†65)¬†57/Ill. appears here/


c) The¬†aru-huba¬†‚Äúsebuc√°n‚Äù (cassava snake) or cylindrical press for bitter cassava (¬†Manihot utilissima) (Fig. 13), in textile weave, is made up of three parts: 1) The¬†[Page 49]¬†57 cont. loop or upper section, woven on a diagonal, is a strap which crowns at its top end the mouth or entrance for the mass of cassava which is to be pressed; 2) The body, also woven on a diagonal, is made up of fibers joined in pairs, which are woven by alternating the matte and glossy sides in a checker board design; 3) The handle or base which is formed by the prolongation of the elements of the weaving. A tie¬†58¬†[Page 50]¬†[Page 52]¬†60¬†of the same ‚Äútirite‚Äù fiber binds them and gives them rigidity. This press is used for the extraction of hydrocyanic acid contained in the bitter cassava (page¬†75);


d) The quadrangular¬†manari¬†sieve (Fig. 14)¬†A¬†is made with a textile weave. The elements of the weft pass over two, under three and then over and under two elements of the warp, in a straight, slightly open weave. In order to bind off, the elements of the weaving are wrapped around two superimposed slim canes and are immediately inserted into the woven surface. The ends of the canes, bound with moriche fiber, stick out slightly from the corners. This sieve is used in sifting the pressed, dry mass of bitter cassava. (page¬†75).


e) The¬†berei¬†fish basket (Fig. 15),¬†B¬†circular in shape, in hexagonal weave, is used to collect the small fish which congregate in the ‚Äúca√±itos‚Äù [creeks] at low tide.


f) The¬†moriki¬†child's rattle, used to entertain small children, comes in two types: cylindrical, woven in diagonal according to textile weave and is finished off at its lower end by a handle in which all the free elements of the weaving are brought together and tied with moriche fiber. It has a geometric design obtained by alternating the matte and the glossy sides of the ‚Äútirite‚Äù (Fig. 16).¬†C¬†The other type of rattle is cubic, woven according to the technique of superimposed layers¬†61¬†(Fig. 17):¬†D¬†the fibers on the outside layer are vertical, while those on the inside are horizontal. Both layers are joined to each other by means of a moriche thread which runs in spiral fashion over the whole surface. The lower end also terminates in a handle similar to that on the previous one.

For a few mornings in the early winter, when the first ice had formed at the edge of the water, children were made to take a dip in a frigid stream; this was thought to provide lifelong protection against colds. At or before puberty, boys were made to feel unwanted and driven out of the house, in hopes that some supernatural being would take pity on them when alone in the woods and give them power, with which to perform some useful occupation in life. Such beings could also appear spontaneously to lost or troubled children and adults, and hence an individual could have power from several visions. In the early twentieth century, conservative Munsees still isolated a girl at her first menses, though in a darkened room rather than a hut. Partial menstrual isolation was also practiced by some Oklahoma Delaware women, in particular by cooking over a separate fire and eating alone. There is a tradition that when the Delaware lived in villages a single large house was built at a distance for all the menstruating women of the community to use together. Zeisberger mentions the special face-concealing headdress of newly marriageable girls but says it was worn for only two months.

Sometimes an adult presented one of these hobbyhorses to a favored child of a prominent man and received property in return (fig. 32). Wissler (1911, p. 53) apparently referred to this type of hobbyhorse, although his description is lacking in detail. 71


71 Similar types of children‚Äôs play were common among other Plains Indian tribes. Cheyenne and Arapaho girls played moving camp with miniature horses made of forked sticks (Michelson, 1932, p. 3; 1933, p. 598). In 1840, Tixier (1940, p. 235) was amused by the play of little Osage girls. ‚ÄúOne walked on all fours like a horse loaded with luggage; after unloading her, her friends helped her to build a small lodge with stakes and a blanket; then all together, horses and horsewomen, going in laughing. On other occasions they drove some pegs in the ground, making a sort of horse with it, and practiced climbing on its back.‚Äù Teton Dakota boys rode wooden hobbyhorses. Sometimes they placed a saddle on a fallen tree and pretended to ride it. Teton boys and girls pretended to be horses and carried packs, while boys of those tribes carried one another on all fours (i. e., ‚Äúhorseback‚Äù) (Dorsey, 1891, pp. 329, 343). Both Teton and Cheyenne boys played with mud images of horses (Dorsey, 1891, p. 335; Grinnell, 1923, vol. 1, p. 65).",2293.1,Hobby horse.,https://ehrafworldcultures.yale.edu/sres/1bb7fbc3-0310-4211-b2e9-b1f1c2464408,49.34,-111.21,1955,6278,Play,Single

A woman who had no children to sew for was, of course, less busy; the mother of a family was obliged not only to make the clothes for the whole household, but to train her girls to be dressmakers also.

The material represents the period from 1893 to 1903. This, of course, was twenty years after the establishment of the San Carlos Reservation, when reservation life had settled into a groove of its own:


We children used to go to the edge of the river where the willows grew. There we made play wickiups of the willows and pretended to live as older people do. Boys and girls used to get married. Although we didn't exchange gifts such as horses at these marriages, we exchanged food and drink. The boy's family would prepare tulibai. There would be twenty-five mounds of earth piled up in a line, each representing one can of tulibai. The man whose daughter was to be married was invited to bring his family over to drink them. As each can was finished, the mound of earth was obliterated. A little later, the girl's family would prepare a great feast and invite the boy's family over. They had round¬†[Page 487]¬†flat pieces of limestone for the dishes and on each would be a different kind of make-believe food. When we got there, they would point out each kind to us, saying, ‚ÄúThis is walnuts; this is acorn meal and stewed meat.‚Äù


When a boy married, he never married his own sister. We knew about that. But we never thought about clan exogamy, and it didn't matter to us whether two children married who were of the same clan. We didn't pretend that they were of different clans. Also, we boys didn't avoid our own blood sisters, nor they us. We were too young for that. We didn't even pretend to avoid them. We began to think about that much later. We didn't joke our real cross-cousins then, either. We were too young.¬†24¬†


24In connection with a child's knowledge of social practices, Neil Buck once remarked, ‚ÄúAs a small boy I heard older people use the expression which signifies that a widow has been reclaimed in marriage by some kinsman of her dead husband. I used to wonder what it meant, and it was several years before I found out.‚Äù


A boy had to respect his parents-in-law and avoid his mother-in-law, so his camp was built at a little distance from that of his wife's parents. Though we called each other by our regular names in play when we wanted to, a man couldn't call the names of his parents-in-law, just as it is with grownups. He called them¬†c√†Àôd√†Àôn√≠`¬†[proper affinal term]. We had brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law whom we called¬†c√¨Œ≥√≠Àô¬†[proper affinal term] as well. We used to pretend that a man had obligations to his father-in-law. We had a play store, and he would have to go to the store all the time to buy things for his father-in-law. When we played family, we pretended we had children, but we never pretended that a woman was pregnant or that she gave birth to a baby. We didn't play that the youngest child was the favorite either, as it is among grownups.


I can remember one time when I was a small kid and we were playing family. One girl of the¬†n√°Œ≥√≤d√®sg√¨jn¬†clan was my mother. There were a lot of other small boys there. We made three or four little piles of dirt, calling them cans of tulibai. When we finished one can, we leveled the pile. Soon we all said we were drunk. I was my mother's only child, so I was alone. The other boys pretended to start a fight with me. They all jumped on me. The girl who was my mother hollered at the top of her lungs as a grown person would do, ‚ÄúThe¬†'√¨y√†`'√°iy‚ñ°¬†[clan] boys are fighting my son.‚Äù She shouted so loud that my real mother and older sister back at camp heard her. They used to laugh afterward when they told about it. But we didn't play at having clan blood-feuds. Maybe some children did, but then, you know, not all children play in the same way.


When we played at family and camp life, we did not pretend that one of us was chief and that others were wealthy, influential men, but we¬†[Page 488]¬†used to have police. When a man had tulibai, these police sometimes came around and caught him. Then the policeman would dump out the tulibai and arrest the man. The tulibai was muddy water. We had a place we pretended was the guardhouse, and the man would be put in there for three or four days. At this guardhouse food was given to the prisoners. We played at issuing rations also, just as they really did at the agency. The rations were issued to us by our police at the guardhouse. We used to ride to the guardhouse on willow sticks, which we said were horses, to receive our rations. The children would all line up in front of the guardhouse to get their rations. One policeman was detailed to watch the line and prevent any trouble which might arise, just as they really did at the agency, and a second issued the rations to us. We did not play school.


We didn't play at having cattle or burros or dogs, but we did play at horses. One boy would be sent out to drive the horses into camp. He would come in, bringing an armful of willow branches. These were the horses. Ration time would be coming round, so we would need the horses to ride in on to get rations. Men and their wives started off riding. If we had to stop on the way for the night, we tied our horses to a tree. Then we would pull up a few handfuls of grass and leave them there for the horse to eat, just as we had seen our elders do.


We boys also used to make wagons out of tin cans. That was before the railroad came through, and we used to see many teams go by on the way to San Carlos and Globe, hauling freight. They would camp along the road and leave tin cans. We made the wagons of these tin cans. We put the can in a fire and heated it until the solder at both ends melted, and the two round ends came loose. These we made into wheels, punching a hole through the centers for the axle. The rest of the tin we flattened out straight. Then we bent each edge down on the long sides. We punched other holes in the bent-down edges, so we could run sticks through for the axles and attach the wheels. We put two wheels in front and only one in back. Through the sides of the wagon bottom we struck upright poles to hold the loads on, just like a real wagon. Almost every boy had one of these. We used to pretend to haul loads of wood on them, lengths of greasewood about seven inches long. We hauled them to the store to sell to the storekeeper. Sometimes we boys played with the wagons by ourselves without girls, pretending that we were freighting. One boy would go ahead, the others following in a long line along the road, just as we had seen freighters go by. We were hauling to the store. When we played at home where the dogs were, we used to make believe they were horses, and pack loads on them. But the dogs would not follow us away from camp, so we had to use willow branches for horses elsewhere.


After we had been playing family and camps down by the river a¬†[Page 489]¬†while, one of the older boys would say he was going to be a white man and run a store. He would make a little inclosure by setting sticks up in the ground. This was the store. Inside, he used sticks to make a sort of shelf to put his goods on. He made things out of mud. These, and stones, were the store goods. The store was always about two hundred yards distant from our camps. When we went to the store to buy things, we used small stones for money. We didn't have any charge accounts.¬†25


25¬†Notice that the store is at a distance from the camp, just as it should be. Charge accounts are now the most common way of doing business, although they were less common in former times.


We never played at hunting large game such as deer, but all boys had bows and arrows and used to go out hunting small game. We really did it; we didn't play at it. We did not play at having farms and raising crops,





at going out to gather wild seeds and acorns, or at cooking mescal. That was the old way, but we had our store to buy food in. Girls used to cook mud in cans on a fire. That was our food. When we made a fire, we made a very small one because our play wickiups were small. A few boys had those small, old-fashioned matches, but the rest of us had to get our fire at home and carry it down to where we played.


Older boys made knives out of tin cans. Only boys, not girls, did this. The knife was made by bending a piece of tin about the end of a stick, so that it stayed in place. One end of the stick served as a handle. The blade was curved and ground to an edge. The older boys who had these knives always carried them in their pockets, so that if they were out hunting and broke an arrow they could fashion another. They always had a pocketful of all kinds of birds' feathers, as well as sinew, so that they could repair or make new arrows at any time.


Boys, not girls, used to pretend to smoke. We would go along the riverbanks where the water had exposed the dry, pithy root of a cottonwood. We smoked sections of this just like a cigar, and in our store the storekeeper had them for sale. We used to take only a few puffs on them and throw them away. We also dried the leaves of¬†tc'√≠≈Çt'√≤j√©`¬†[‚Äúone sucks it‚Äù (sour dock)] and kept them in a little sack. We rolled cigarettes with these, using the paper from sugar or coffee packages which we picked up at home. Our families did not scold us for doing this. We didn't make ropes to play with. The girls used to make dolls. Little girls made dolls by bundling old rags together and tying them around the middle. Sometimes they made the hair of shredded cloth. We didn't paint our faces, but we used to tattoo marks on our skin‚Äîjust marks, not letters. We put them on our wrists, hands, and faces.


[Page 490]


Sometimes we played at having a social dance. We made a little drum out of a tin can. We put some water inside and stretched a piece of cloth across the mouth, tying it there. There would be a whole crowd of children, just like big people gathered at a dance. The boys would sing and sometimes the little girls would sing also. We sang old CJ37's songs, his lightning songs.¬†26¬†


26¬†CJ37 was a very powerful lightning shaman in the community.


Some of the little boys would tell the little girls to go out and start dancing. They would, several of them dancing back and forth together to the music. Then the boys would tell them to dance¬†≈Ç√†d√†tc'√¨tc'√πc¬†[a type of social dance], and the little girls would pick partners from among the boys to dance with them. Most of these children were from six to eight years old. Older children didn't take part in it. We danced in the daytime, right beside our own homes.


We never played at having a puberty ceremony for a girl, at holding curing ceremonies for sick people, at giving a hunting ceremony, or at singing deer, snake, or other such sacred songs. But we did play at giving the¬†g√°Àôn¬†dance and social dances. One boy called¬†nd√®Àôz√©`¬†[‚Äútall one‚Äù] was the leader in our community in any play of this sort. I guess he did not wish to play at curing rites or hunting ceremonies, or we might have done it. As he took the initiative in such things, we merely followed him. He was about sixteen at the time all this happened, and I must have been around ten. Some of the other boys were big boys, fourteen and fifteen years old.¬†nd√®Àôz√©`¬†is still living at Fort Apache. He used to pretend he was the father of John Roberson [a famous¬†g√°Àôn¬†shaman at that time] and knew all the¬†g√°Àôn¬†power. He made small¬†g√°Àôn¬†masks for us to wear from the left-over pieces when the men made real¬†g√°Àôn¬†masks for a ceremony. They were of the sotol stalk. We gave these¬†g√°Àôn¬†dances at night. We didn't even pretend to be curing anyone, but just gave them to have the dance.¬†nd√®Àôz√©`¬†himself painted the boys who were going to dance as¬†g√°Àôn.¬†When John Roberson's father used to paint his own dancers, at the end he put a dot of white paint on each of his cheeks and then ran the ends of his fingers dipped in white paint down the backs of his hands in a zigzag. So this boy used to do the same thing. Then he walked out to where we had the fire and called out¬†h√†g√∫Àô, h√†g√∫Àô,¬†just as John Roberson's father did. This was a signal for the impersonators to make their entry.


We used to hold this dance not far from our own homes.¬†nd√®Àôz√©`¬†sang for us. He sang real¬†g√°Àôn¬†songs, ones belonging to this same¬†g√°Àôn¬†shaman which he had picked up from hearing him sing them. He used to have a regular-sized drum made from a large can. He always brought it out when we had a dance. I don't know where he kept it. After the¬†g√°Àôn¬†dance was finished, we would have the circle dance.¬†27¬†


27¬†This customarily follows the completion of the¬†g√°Àôn¬†dance.


After the¬†[Page 491]¬†circle dance, we danced¬†≈Ç√®d√†tc'√¨tc'√πc.¬†Sometimes it used to turn into a real big dance, older youths and maidens coming down and joining in, helping to carry it through. We younger boys and girls would social dance also. Little girls walked up to a boy and touched him on the shoulder, inviting him to dance, just like grownups. But when only we younger children were playing at it, the dance petered out after a while. We would get tired of it. For the social dancing,¬†nd√®Àôz√©`¬†and some of the rest of us boys sang lightning songs, ones that belonged to the old man, CJ37. He knew we used them, but he didn't seem to mind. When the dance was finished, we put the¬†g√°Àôn¬†masks away in the brush for the night. The next morning we would conceal them where no one could find them, just as a real¬†g√°Àôn¬†shaman would do with his masks. Grownups didn't come to watch these dances of ours. They didn't seem to bother particularly about them, though sometimes our parents would tell us not to do it any more. But you know how kids are. They don't always obey their parents. We kept it up.


John Roberson's father used to give his¬†g√°Àôn¬†dance at almost every girl's puberty ceremony. After the ceremony he put the masks away in a cave across the river, not so far from where we lived. Other shamans who had ceremonial articles to be put away used the same cave. There was a great deal of ceremonial material in this cave.¬†28¬†


28¬†Such ceremonial objects, once put away, are never used again. It would be very dangerous to disturb them.


Sometimes when just we boys were off in the hills during the daytime, without any girls, we would go to this cave, take the masks out, put them on, and pretend to dance. This was under the leadership of¬†nd√®Àôz√©`.¬†But we never touched the hoops or crosses of the lightning shamans which were there. We were afraid of them.¬†29¬†


29¬†Lightning is the most dreaded of all supernatural forces.


We fooled around with the masks for an hour or so and then put them back and went on our way.¬†30¬†


30¬†The same thing was recorded for aboriginal times.


One time, I and some other boys went past this cave.¬†nd√®Àôz√©`,¬†who was with us, said, ‚ÄúCome on, let's have a dance.‚Äù We got the masks out, and he put them on us and painted us all up. We made dancing kilts by wrapping our shirts about our waists. Then he told us to wait there, that he was going off a little way, and, when he gave the call and started to sing, to come out and dance. We stood there, waiting. We waited and waited, but he did not call. Finally he took off the masks and went to see what was the matter. He was not there. He had played a joke and run off and left us. Not long after this, John Roberson's father must have found out what we boys had been doing. He must have dreamed about it, for he said, ‚ÄúSome boy is doing the same way I do.‚Äù He meant that someone had been using his masks.¬†[Page 492]¬†He was angry. But he didn't mind us children making our own small masks and putting on dances at home in which we used his songs. Later on, when¬†nd√®Àôz√©`¬†grew up, this same¬†g√°Àôn¬†shaman used him as a real¬†g√°Àôn¬†dancer. He was a very good one and danced many times, but he never became a¬†g√°Àôn¬†shaman.


There are no children's songs. The only songs that children sing are ones they hear grownups sing. I first started to sing when I was about six or seven. I sang a few songs such as the lightning songs of CJ37, but I only knew parts, not the whole song. I also was able to sing snatches of love songs that I had heard, but I couldn't sing any social dance songs. They were too hard. All of us kids would try to sing parts of such songs as these, but it wasn't until I was about ten that I first really started to learn whole songs. Old CJ37 often sang all night at curing or other ceremonies. He sang lightning songs and medicine songs, as well as others. We boys weren't meant to attend these ceremonies, but we did. The first song I learned to sing was a lightning song. We used to go to the curing ceremonies of CJ13, another shaman. He had all kinds of power for curing sicknesses: snake power, bear power, and others. From hearing these songs sung, we boys learned them. We could not sing the words, but we could sing the choruses. We used to try out one song at our play dances and sing it over and over again until we finally learned it. Then we would learn another and start using it.


We did not play at death and burial. We never did. I don't think it was because we were afraid of it. It was mainly because we never thought about playing that way. Besides, we didn't have the amount of sickness and death then that we have had since.


By the time I was old enough to join in the boys' war game [after eleven or twelve], boys had ceased playing it. But when I was a small boy, not yet old enough to join in, I can remember older boys playing it. Down at Dewey Flats, the Eastern White Mountain camps were on one side of the river, the Western White Mountain camps on the other. The boys from each side played this game against one another. They fought with slings and stones. The Yavapai, camped on the river below us, fought the Arivaipa boys near them in the same way. Big boys and sometimes men took part. Once I was swimming in the river with another small boy. We had no clothes on. A Yavapai youth came along and slung a stone at us. We got up and ran. We tried to throw rocks at him, but missed. We escaped into some thick brush and lay there. He could not see us but slung a stone blindly into the thicket. It hit me right on the buttocks. Years later I met this Yavapai as a man. We talked about that time and laughed.


When I was a boy of ten or so, I used to pretend to play at ‚Äúhidden-ball‚Äù with other boys my age. We didn't play with moccasins but hid¬†[Page 493]¬†the ball in the ground. We learned this game from the San Carlos people. We used to go and watch grown men playing it, for they played it not far from the camps. That's how we learned it. After watching a game among the men, boys were likely to start one of their own the next day. We played either during the day or at night, sometimes inside the wickiup. But we just played a little while and then quit. We would bet arrows and marbles with each other. Little girls came and watched us, just like women do at a real game, but they never played. When I was older, I and other boys my age played at hoop-and-poles. But until boys were about fifteen years old they never played this game. It was a man's game. I can remember when I and two friends of mine played it. We had a set of poles made of batamota, and our hoop was of mesquite root. Sometimes, boys made their hoop-and-poles of willow. A boy who owned a set always took it home with him at night after the game, just as a man would do. We had lots of fun playing at this game. There would be a whole lot of boys, just as there were many men about a hoop-and-poles course when they played. We knew exactly how to play it, and our hoops had ‚Äúbig bead‚Äù in the middle, with fifty beads, sometimes sixty-one beads, on each side.¬†31¬†


31¬†Beads are the coils about a cord tied across the diameter of the hoop. They are used in scoring.


We gambled, betting our marbles and tops, but we never pretended to have gambling power for this game. We didn't know about that. Boys weren't allowed to use a real set of hoop-and-poles for fear they would damage them. Just as no women or girls were allowed around when men played hoop-and-poles, we boys didn't let any girls come where we were playing.


Up to ten years old or so boys and girls very often played together, but after eleven or twelve they separated. The sort of play I have told you about [all the preceding, excluding the hoop-and-poles game, the play with the real¬†g√°Àôn¬†masks, and the boy's war game] was mainly girls and boys together. Boys alone didn't play at family, marriage, cooking, making wickiups, or rations. After a boy was eleven or twelve, he spent most of his time going about in groups with other boys, hunting birds and small animals, sometimes all day and even at night, or playing certain boy's games which I will tell you about. Girls played separately from big boys after this age also. Many girls played until they were fifteen or so. They made wickiups just as we did when younger, but these were larger and better made, about six feet high. Inside they played at household with little children, both boys and girls, though these little kids were just there mainly to watch them. That's the way small children learn to play. The big girls would play at cooking. They didn't pretend mud was their food, the way small children do, but they boiled water, pretending it was tulibai and such things. They used to¬†[Page [facing p.494]]





[Page 494]¬†make dolls, really good ones, and clothe them in girl's dresses which they sewed. They made the hair of real hair so that it hung down the back. They made miniature moccasins of buckskin for them. They knew how to make good dolls.


We big boys used to hunt kangaroo rats out in the brush at night-time. We didn't eat them. We just killed them. One time a bunch of us boys went across the river from Dewey Flats and killed a whole sackful. There was an old woman living near by who was so old that she was in her second childhood. She spent most of her time asleep. That night we crept into her wickiup and put the sack of rats at the side of her bed as she slept. She slept with the kangaroo rats all night, not knowing it. Next morning I guess she was mad when she found out. Sometimes we boys hunted quail at night. We crossed back and forth across the Gila River as many as two and three times in a night doing this, even in wintertime. I and one of my cross-cousins were out like this one night. We thought we saw a duck in the river. We shot at it. It was just an old stick. We lost our arrow and so we built a fire and made another one by its light. At other times we went up toward Turn-bull Mountain, where there were many cactus plants growing. The quail roosted on these, and we killed them. Sometimes three or four of us would ride burros out into the hills to shoot doves during their nesting season. They were easy to hit when they sat on the nest. When we went out in the hills to hunt, the oldest boy was always the leader. We went where he said. When we killed birds, sometimes we would stop and cook and eat them.


We used to play at renegades and soldiers. CJ30 played with us. He was a lot older than the rest of us. He always used to take the part of Apache Kid, and one other boy always took the part of a Chiricahua renegade. The rest of us were soldiers and scouts and would try to capture these two. There were two hills where we usually played this game. The renegades would come out on the side of one hill and holler at us. Then they would come out on the other side of the hill and shout. We used horse manure as bullets. If you got hit by one of these bullets, you were dead right there. For our captain we had one lame boy. There were boys older than he who could have been captain, but we made him captain because he could not travel fast and was always in the rear.¬†32¬†


32¬†Old scouts often speak of how their white officers were unable to keep up with them on foot during campaigns against hostile Apache.


We always played this game at night. One evening when we were playing we saw a man coming riding toward us. We could see the glint of his rifle barrel in the moonlight. It was only the older brother of Elton Causey coming home from a party, but, thinking it was really Apache Kid, we got scared and all ran off. Our captain was left behind. He hollered at us. Later, the same evening, the oldest¬†[Page [facing p. 495]]





[Page 495]¬†boys among us went up to where some white men, freighting with wagons, had camped for the night. They crept into the camp and stole some biscuits out of a dutch oven. They took a can of salt too. They brought this back to where the rest of us were waiting. We split the biscuits up between us, put salt on them, and ate them. Each one of us got one. This was to feed us soldiers. The white men must have been very sound asleep. The next morning a white man from the camp climbed up on top of a hill where he could overlook our camps. He thought we had taken the biscuits, but he didn't say anything.


One time I, Charley Sago,¬†nd√®Àôz√©`,¬†and some other boys went down river to where the Yavapai were living. We hung about all day. We saw that the Yavapai had a lot of good melons in their fields. We waited until night and then went into the fields and ate our fill of them. We gathered more melons and took them up to where some Mexican freighters were camped on the road. They gave us a meal and some sugar and coffee in exchange for the melons. We left, and after we had gone a little way we could hear the Mexicans commence to shout. We thought that the Yavapai must have found the Mexicans with their melons and that they would soon be on our trail. We ran for it. After a while we heard someone coming on horseback, so we split up. It was too dark to see. When the rider was close, one of the boys hollered, ‚ÄúHello.‚Äù The man answered ‚ÄúHello‚Äù and went on. After going a way farther, we stopped and built a fire to warm ourselves. From there we went to our homes. When I got home, I found mother telling stories with an old woman. That's the way old women used to do. They had cooked up some corn and were eating it. I had some of the coffee and sugar tied in the corner of my shirt. Mother asked me where I got it, and I told her that the Mexicans had given it to me. But I really got it for the melons I had stolen.


I can't remember the children that I played with before I was ten, but from then on, until I went off to school at fourteen, my two best friends were Paul Nosey and Elton Causey. The first died in school.¬†33¬†


33¬†The second boy mentioned was not a close friend of the narrator's in adult life.


The second didn't go to school at the same time I did, but not long after that mother told me he went to our camp and lay down on my bed and told her, ‚ÄúWell, I guess I'll go to school also.‚Äù He didn't have to go, but he wanted to be with me. The first I knew of it, I saw him there at the school, with his hair already cut like a schoolboy. All three of us were of the same band. We always went about together. Paul was my cross-cousin by clan because his clan was related to that of my father. He was also the son of my mother's half-sister's son. Because of this, our families always camped close together, and that is how I got to know him so well. Elton was of the same clan as Paul and so was also¬†[Page 496]¬†my cross-cousin. Whenever we traveled, Elton and his mother used to accompany us, as she was a great friend of my mother's.


Another boy whom I went about with a great deal was the younger brother of Henry Hudson. He was of my father's clan [also a cross-cousin]. There was a boy named Calvin I used to see a lot of. His father's clan and my father's clan were the same, so we were parallel cousins, but I didn't know he was my brother in this way until very much later.¬†nd√®Àôz√©`,¬†the boy who used to be the leader of the¬†g√°Àôn¬†dances, was also a parallel cousin of mine for the same reason. This I did not know until we had grown up. There were other boys we saw, but I saw most of the first four above. There must have been about twenty-five of us boys who played around together. We were of varying ages. We didn't always play together, but often split up to play in small groups because some would want to go one way, some another. Some days there wasn't anything doing at all, and at other times fathers wouldn't let their boys go off to play because they had work for them to do, such as going after the horses.

The material represents the period from 1893 to 1903. This, of course, was twenty years after the establishment of the San Carlos Reservation, when reservation life had settled into a groove of its own:


We children used to go to the edge of the river where the willows grew. There we made play wickiups of the willows and pretended to live as older people do. Boys and girls used to get married. Although we didn't exchange gifts such as horses at these marriages, we exchanged food and drink. The boy's family would prepare tulibai. There would be twenty-five mounds of earth piled up in a line, each representing one can of tulibai. The man whose daughter was to be married was invited to bring his family over to drink them. As each can was finished, the mound of earth was obliterated. A little later, the girl's family would prepare a great feast and invite the boy's family over. They had round¬†[Page 487]¬†flat pieces of limestone for the dishes and on each would be a different kind of make-believe food. When we got there, they would point out each kind to us, saying, ‚ÄúThis is walnuts; this is acorn meal and stewed meat.‚Äù


When a boy married, he never married his own sister. We knew about that. But we never thought about clan exogamy, and it didn't matter to us whether two children married who were of the same clan. We didn't pretend that they were of different clans. Also, we boys didn't avoid our own blood sisters, nor they us. We were too young for that. We didn't even pretend to avoid them. We began to think about that much later. We didn't joke our real cross-cousins then, either. We were too young.¬†24¬†


24In connection with a child's knowledge of social practices, Neil Buck once remarked, ‚ÄúAs a small boy I heard older people use the expression which signifies that a widow has been reclaimed in marriage by some kinsman of her dead husband. I used to wonder what it meant, and it was several years before I found out.‚Äù


A boy had to respect his parents-in-law and avoid his mother-in-law, so his camp was built at a little distance from that of his wife's parents. Though we called each other by our regular names in play when we wanted to, a man couldn't call the names of his parents-in-law, just as it is with grownups. He called them¬†c√†Àôd√†Àôn√≠`¬†[proper affinal term]. We had brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law whom we called¬†c√¨Œ≥√≠Àô¬†[proper affinal term] as well. We used to pretend that a man had obligations to his father-in-law. We had a play store, and he would have to go to the store all the time to buy things for his father-in-law. When we played family, we pretended we had children, but we never pretended that a woman was pregnant or that she gave birth to a baby. We didn't play that the youngest child was the favorite either, as it is among grownups.


I can remember one time when I was a small kid and we were playing family. One girl of the¬†n√°Œ≥√≤d√®sg√¨jn¬†clan was my mother. There were a lot of other small boys there. We made three or four little piles of dirt, calling them cans of tulibai. When we finished one can, we leveled the pile. Soon we all said we were drunk. I was my mother's only child, so I was alone. The other boys pretended to start a fight with me. They all jumped on me. The girl who was my mother hollered at the top of her lungs as a grown person would do, ‚ÄúThe¬†'√¨y√†`'√°iy‚ñ°¬†[clan] boys are fighting my son.‚Äù She shouted so loud that my real mother and older sister back at camp heard her. They used to laugh afterward when they told about it. But we didn't play at having clan blood-feuds. Maybe some children did, but then, you know, not all children play in the same way.


When we played at family and camp life, we did not pretend that one of us was chief and that others were wealthy, influential men, but we¬†[Page 488]¬†used to have police. When a man had tulibai, these police sometimes came around and caught him. Then the policeman would dump out the tulibai and arrest the man. The tulibai was muddy water. We had a place we pretended was the guardhouse, and the man would be put in there for three or four days. At this guardhouse food was given to the prisoners. We played at issuing rations also, just as they really did at the agency. The rations were issued to us by our police at the guardhouse. We used to ride to the guardhouse on willow sticks, which we said were horses, to receive our rations. The children would all line up in front of the guardhouse to get their rations. One policeman was detailed to watch the line and prevent any trouble which might arise, just as they really did at the agency, and a second issued the rations to us. We did not play school.


We didn't play at having cattle or burros or dogs, but we did play at horses. One boy would be sent out to drive the horses into camp. He would come in, bringing an armful of willow branches. These were the horses. Ration time would be coming round, so we would need the horses to ride in on to get rations. Men and their wives started off riding. If we had to stop on the way for the night, we tied our horses to a tree. Then we would pull up a few handfuls of grass and leave them there for the horse to eat, just as we had seen our elders do.


We boys also used to make wagons out of tin cans. That was before the railroad came through, and we used to see many teams go by on the way to San Carlos and Globe, hauling freight. They would camp along the road and leave tin cans. We made the wagons of these tin cans. We put the can in a fire and heated it until the solder at both ends melted, and the two round ends came loose. These we made into wheels, punching a hole through the centers for the axle. The rest of the tin we flattened out straight. Then we bent each edge down on the long sides. We punched other holes in the bent-down edges, so we could run sticks through for the axles and attach the wheels. We put two wheels in front and only one in back. Through the sides of the wagon bottom we struck upright poles to hold the loads on, just like a real wagon. Almost every boy had one of these. We used to pretend to haul loads of wood on them, lengths of greasewood about seven inches long. We hauled them to the store to sell to the storekeeper. Sometimes we boys played with the wagons by ourselves without girls, pretending that we were freighting. One boy would go ahead, the others following in a long line along the road, just as we had seen freighters go by. We were hauling to the store. When we played at home where the dogs were, we used to make believe they were horses, and pack loads on them. But the dogs would not follow us away from camp, so we had to use willow branches for horses elsewhere.


After we had been playing family and camps down by the river a¬†[Page 489]¬†while, one of the older boys would say he was going to be a white man and run a store. He would make a little inclosure by setting sticks up in the ground. This was the store. Inside, he used sticks to make a sort of shelf to put his goods on. He made things out of mud. These, and stones, were the store goods. The store was always about two hundred yards distant from our camps. When we went to the store to buy things, we used small stones for money. We didn't have any charge accounts.¬†25


25¬†Notice that the store is at a distance from the camp, just as it should be. Charge accounts are now the most common way of doing business, although they were less common in former times.


We never played at hunting large game such as deer, but all boys had bows and arrows and used to go out hunting small game. We really did it; we didn't play at it. We did not play at having farms and raising crops,





at going out to gather wild seeds and acorns, or at cooking mescal. That was the old way, but we had our store to buy food in. Girls used to cook mud in cans on a fire. That was our food. When we made a fire, we made a very small one because our play wickiups were small. A few boys had those small, old-fashioned matches, but the rest of us had to get our fire at home and carry it down to where we played.


Older boys made knives out of tin cans. Only boys, not girls, did this. The knife was made by bending a piece of tin about the end of a stick, so that it stayed in place. One end of the stick served as a handle. The blade was curved and ground to an edge. The older boys who had these knives always carried them in their pockets, so that if they were out hunting and broke an arrow they could fashion another. They always had a pocketful of all kinds of birds' feathers, as well as sinew, so that they could repair or make new arrows at any time.


Boys, not girls, used to pretend to smoke. We would go along the riverbanks where the water had exposed the dry, pithy root of a cottonwood. We smoked sections of this just like a cigar, and in our store the storekeeper had them for sale. We used to take only a few puffs on them and throw them away. We also dried the leaves of¬†tc'√≠≈Çt'√≤j√©`¬†[‚Äúone sucks it‚Äù (sour dock)] and kept them in a little sack. We rolled cigarettes with these, using the paper from sugar or coffee packages which we picked up at home. Our families did not scold us for doing this. We didn't make ropes to play with. The girls used to make dolls. Little girls made dolls by bundling old rags together and tying them around the middle. Sometimes they made the hair of shredded cloth. We didn't paint our faces, but we used to tattoo marks on our skin‚Äîjust marks, not letters. We put them on our wrists, hands, and faces.


[Page 490]


Sometimes we played at having a social dance. We made a little drum out of a tin can. We put some water inside and stretched a piece of cloth across the mouth, tying it there. There would be a whole crowd of children, just like big people gathered at a dance. The boys would sing and sometimes the little girls would sing also. We sang old CJ37's songs, his lightning songs.¬†26¬†


26¬†CJ37 was a very powerful lightning shaman in the community.


Some of the little boys would tell the little girls to go out and start dancing. They would, several of them dancing back and forth together to the music. Then the boys would tell them to dance¬†≈Ç√†d√†tc'√¨tc'√πc¬†[a type of social dance], and the little girls would pick partners from among the boys to dance with them. Most of these children were from six to eight years old. Older children didn't take part in it. We danced in the daytime, right beside our own homes.


We never played at having a puberty ceremony for a girl, at holding curing ceremonies for sick people, at giving a hunting ceremony, or at singing deer, snake, or other such sacred songs. But we did play at giving the¬†g√°Àôn¬†dance and social dances. One boy called¬†nd√®Àôz√©`¬†[‚Äútall one‚Äù] was the leader in our community in any play of this sort. I guess he did not wish to play at curing rites or hunting ceremonies, or we might have done it. As he took the initiative in such things, we merely followed him. He was about sixteen at the time all this happened, and I must have been around ten. Some of the other boys were big boys, fourteen and fifteen years old.¬†nd√®Àôz√©`¬†is still living at Fort Apache. He used to pretend he was the father of John Roberson [a famous¬†g√°Àôn¬†shaman at that time] and knew all the¬†g√°Àôn¬†power. He made small¬†g√°Àôn¬†masks for us to wear from the left-over pieces when the men made real¬†g√°Àôn¬†masks for a ceremony. They were of the sotol stalk. We gave these¬†g√°Àôn¬†dances at night. We didn't even pretend to be curing anyone, but just gave them to have the dance.¬†nd√®Àôz√©`¬†himself painted the boys who were going to dance as¬†g√°Àôn.¬†When John Roberson's father used to paint his own dancers, at the end he put a dot of white paint on each of his cheeks and then ran the ends of his fingers dipped in white paint down the backs of his hands in a zigzag. So this boy used to do the same thing. Then he walked out to where we had the fire and called out¬†h√†g√∫Àô, h√†g√∫Àô,¬†just as John Roberson's father did. This was a signal for the impersonators to make their entry.


We used to hold this dance not far from our own homes.¬†nd√®Àôz√©`¬†sang for us. He sang real¬†g√°Àôn¬†songs, ones belonging to this same¬†g√°Àôn¬†shaman which he had picked up from hearing him sing them. He used to have a regular-sized drum made from a large can. He always brought it out when we had a dance. I don't know where he kept it. After the¬†g√°Àôn¬†dance was finished, we would have the circle dance.¬†27¬†


27¬†This customarily follows the completion of the¬†g√°Àôn¬†dance.


After the¬†[Page 491]¬†circle dance, we danced¬†≈Ç√®d√†tc'√¨tc'√πc.¬†Sometimes it used to turn into a real big dance, older youths and maidens coming down and joining in, helping to carry it through. We younger boys and girls would social dance also. Little girls walked up to a boy and touched him on the shoulder, inviting him to dance, just like grownups. But when only we younger children were playing at it, the dance petered out after a while. We would get tired of it. For the social dancing,¬†nd√®Àôz√©`¬†and some of the rest of us boys sang lightning songs, ones that belonged to the old man, CJ37. He knew we used them, but he didn't seem to mind. When the dance was finished, we put the¬†g√°Àôn¬†masks away in the brush for the night. The next morning we would conceal them where no one could find them, just as a real¬†g√°Àôn¬†shaman would do with his masks. Grownups didn't come to watch these dances of ours. They didn't seem to bother particularly about them, though sometimes our parents would tell us not to do it any more. But you know how kids are. They don't always obey their parents. We kept it up.


John Roberson's father used to give his¬†g√°Àôn¬†dance at almost every girl's puberty ceremony. After the ceremony he put the masks away in a cave across the river, not so far from where we lived. Other shamans who had ceremonial articles to be put away used the same cave. There was a great deal of ceremonial material in this cave.¬†28¬†


28¬†Such ceremonial objects, once put away, are never used again. It would be very dangerous to disturb them.


Sometimes when just we boys were off in the hills during the daytime, without any girls, we would go to this cave, take the masks out, put them on, and pretend to dance. This was under the leadership of¬†nd√®Àôz√©`.¬†But we never touched the hoops or crosses of the lightning shamans which were there. We were afraid of them.¬†29¬†


29¬†Lightning is the most dreaded of all supernatural forces.


We fooled around with the masks for an hour or so and then put them back and went on our way.¬†30¬†


30¬†The same thing was recorded for aboriginal times.


One time, I and some other boys went past this cave.¬†nd√®Àôz√©`,¬†who was with us, said, ‚ÄúCome on, let's have a dance.‚Äù We got the masks out, and he put them on us and painted us all up. We made dancing kilts by wrapping our shirts about our waists. Then he told us to wait there, that he was going off a little way, and, when he gave the call and started to sing, to come out and dance. We stood there, waiting. We waited and waited, but he did not call. Finally he took off the masks and went to see what was the matter. He was not there. He had played a joke and run off and left us. Not long after this, John Roberson's father must have found out what we boys had been doing. He must have dreamed about it, for he said, ‚ÄúSome boy is doing the same way I do.‚Äù He meant that someone had been using his masks.¬†[Page 492]¬†He was angry. But he didn't mind us children making our own small masks and putting on dances at home in which we used his songs. Later on, when¬†nd√®Àôz√©`¬†grew up, this same¬†g√°Àôn¬†shaman used him as a real¬†g√°Àôn¬†dancer. He was a very good one and danced many times, but he never became a¬†g√°Àôn¬†shaman.


There are no children's songs. The only songs that children sing are ones they hear grownups sing. I first started to sing when I was about six or seven. I sang a few songs such as the lightning songs of CJ37, but I only knew parts, not the whole song. I also was able to sing snatches of love songs that I had heard, but I couldn't sing any social dance songs. They were too hard. All of us kids would try to sing parts of such songs as these, but it wasn't until I was about ten that I first really started to learn whole songs. Old CJ37 often sang all night at curing or other ceremonies. He sang lightning songs and medicine songs, as well as others. We boys weren't meant to attend these ceremonies, but we did. The first song I learned to sing was a lightning song. We used to go to the curing ceremonies of CJ13, another shaman. He had all kinds of power for curing sicknesses: snake power, bear power, and others. From hearing these songs sung, we boys learned them. We could not sing the words, but we could sing the choruses. We used to try out one song at our play dances and sing it over and over again until we finally learned it. Then we would learn another and start using it.


We did not play at death and burial. We never did. I don't think it was because we were afraid of it. It was mainly because we never thought about playing that way. Besides, we didn't have the amount of sickness and death then that we have had since.


By the time I was old enough to join in the boys' war game [after eleven or twelve], boys had ceased playing it. But when I was a small boy, not yet old enough to join in, I can remember older boys playing it. Down at Dewey Flats, the Eastern White Mountain camps were on one side of the river, the Western White Mountain camps on the other. The boys from each side played this game against one another. They fought with slings and stones. The Yavapai, camped on the river below us, fought the Arivaipa boys near them in the same way. Big boys and sometimes men took part. Once I was swimming in the river with another small boy. We had no clothes on. A Yavapai youth came along and slung a stone at us. We got up and ran. We tried to throw rocks at him, but missed. We escaped into some thick brush and lay there. He could not see us but slung a stone blindly into the thicket. It hit me right on the buttocks. Years later I met this Yavapai as a man. We talked about that time and laughed.


When I was a boy of ten or so, I used to pretend to play at ‚Äúhidden-ball‚Äù with other boys my age. We didn't play with moccasins but hid¬†[Page 493]¬†the ball in the ground. We learned this game from the San Carlos people. We used to go and watch grown men playing it, for they played it not far from the camps. That's how we learned it. After watching a game among the men, boys were likely to start one of their own the next day. We played either during the day or at night, sometimes inside the wickiup. But we just played a little while and then quit. We would bet arrows and marbles with each other. Little girls came and watched us, just like women do at a real game, but they never played. When I was older, I and other boys my age played at hoop-and-poles. But until boys were about fifteen years old they never played this game. It was a man's game. I can remember when I and two friends of mine played it. We had a set of poles made of batamota, and our hoop was of mesquite root. Sometimes, boys made their hoop-and-poles of willow. A boy who owned a set always took it home with him at night after the game, just as a man would do. We had lots of fun playing at this game. There would be a whole lot of boys, just as there were many men about a hoop-and-poles course when they played. We knew exactly how to play it, and our hoops had ‚Äúbig bead‚Äù in the middle, with fifty beads, sometimes sixty-one beads, on each side.¬†31¬†


31¬†Beads are the coils about a cord tied across the diameter of the hoop. They are used in scoring.


We gambled, betting our marbles and tops, but we never pretended to have gambling power for this game. We didn't know about that. Boys weren't allowed to use a real set of hoop-and-poles for fear they would damage them. Just as no women or girls were allowed around when men played hoop-and-poles, we boys didn't let any girls come where we were playing.


Up to ten years old or so boys and girls very often played together, but after eleven or twelve they separated. The sort of play I have told you about [all the preceding, excluding the hoop-and-poles game, the play with the real¬†g√°Àôn¬†masks, and the boy's war game] was mainly girls and boys together. Boys alone didn't play at family, marriage, cooking, making wickiups, or rations. After a boy was eleven or twelve, he spent most of his time going about in groups with other boys, hunting birds and small animals, sometimes all day and even at night, or playing certain boy's games which I will tell you about. Girls played separately from big boys after this age also. Many girls played until they were fifteen or so. They made wickiups just as we did when younger, but these were larger and better made, about six feet high. Inside they played at household with little children, both boys and girls, though these little kids were just there mainly to watch them. That's the way small children learn to play. The big girls would play at cooking. They didn't pretend mud was their food, the way small children do, but they boiled water, pretending it was tulibai and such things. They used to¬†[Page [facing p.494]]





[Page 494]¬†make dolls, really good ones, and clothe them in girl's dresses which they sewed. They made the hair of real hair so that it hung down the back. They made miniature moccasins of buckskin for them. They knew how to make good dolls.


We big boys used to hunt kangaroo rats out in the brush at night-time. We didn't eat them. We just killed them. One time a bunch of us boys went across the river from Dewey Flats and killed a whole sackful. There was an old woman living near by who was so old that she was in her second childhood. She spent most of her time asleep. That night we crept into her wickiup and put the sack of rats at the side of her bed as she slept. She slept with the kangaroo rats all night, not knowing it. Next morning I guess she was mad when she found out. Sometimes we boys hunted quail at night. We crossed back and forth across the Gila River as many as two and three times in a night doing this, even in wintertime. I and one of my cross-cousins were out like this one night. We thought we saw a duck in the river. We shot at it. It was just an old stick. We lost our arrow and so we built a fire and made another one by its light. At other times we went up toward Turn-bull Mountain, where there were many cactus plants growing. The quail roosted on these, and we killed them. Sometimes three or four of us would ride burros out into the hills to shoot doves during their nesting season. They were easy to hit when they sat on the nest. When we went out in the hills to hunt, the oldest boy was always the leader. We went where he said. When we killed birds, sometimes we would stop and cook and eat them.


We used to play at renegades and soldiers. CJ30 played with us. He was a lot older than the rest of us. He always used to take the part of Apache Kid, and one other boy always took the part of a Chiricahua renegade. The rest of us were soldiers and scouts and would try to capture these two. There were two hills where we usually played this game. The renegades would come out on the side of one hill and holler at us. Then they would come out on the other side of the hill and shout. We used horse manure as bullets. If you got hit by one of these bullets, you were dead right there. For our captain we had one lame boy. There were boys older than he who could have been captain, but we made him captain because he could not travel fast and was always in the rear.¬†32¬†


32¬†Old scouts often speak of how their white officers were unable to keep up with them on foot during campaigns against hostile Apache.


We always played this game at night. One evening when we were playing we saw a man coming riding toward us. We could see the glint of his rifle barrel in the moonlight. It was only the older brother of Elton Causey coming home from a party, but, thinking it was really Apache Kid, we got scared and all ran off. Our captain was left behind. He hollered at us. Later, the same evening, the oldest¬†[Page [facing p. 495]]





[Page 495]¬†boys among us went up to where some white men, freighting with wagons, had camped for the night. They crept into the camp and stole some biscuits out of a dutch oven. They took a can of salt too. They brought this back to where the rest of us were waiting. We split the biscuits up between us, put salt on them, and ate them. Each one of us got one. This was to feed us soldiers. The white men must have been very sound asleep. The next morning a white man from the camp climbed up on top of a hill where he could overlook our camps. He thought we had taken the biscuits, but he didn't say anything.


One time I, Charley Sago,¬†nd√®Àôz√©`,¬†and some other boys went down river to where the Yavapai were living. We hung about all day. We saw that the Yavapai had a lot of good melons in their fields. We waited until night and then went into the fields and ate our fill of them. We gathered more melons and took them up to where some Mexican freighters were camped on the road. They gave us a meal and some sugar and coffee in exchange for the melons. We left, and after we had gone a little way we could hear the Mexicans commence to shout. We thought that the Yavapai must have found the Mexicans with their melons and that they would soon be on our trail. We ran for it. After a while we heard someone coming on horseback, so we split up. It was too dark to see. When the rider was close, one of the boys hollered, ‚ÄúHello.‚Äù The man answered ‚ÄúHello‚Äù and went on. After going a way farther, we stopped and built a fire to warm ourselves. From there we went to our homes. When I got home, I found mother telling stories with an old woman. That's the way old women used to do. They had cooked up some corn and were eating it. I had some of the coffee and sugar tied in the corner of my shirt. Mother asked me where I got it, and I told her that the Mexicans had given it to me. But I really got it for the melons I had stolen.


I can't remember the children that I played with before I was ten, but from then on, until I went off to school at fourteen, my two best friends were Paul Nosey and Elton Causey. The first died in school.¬†33¬†


33¬†The second boy mentioned was not a close friend of the narrator's in adult life.


The second didn't go to school at the same time I did, but not long after that mother told me he went to our camp and lay down on my bed and told her, ‚ÄúWell, I guess I'll go to school also.‚Äù He didn't have to go, but he wanted to be with me. The first I knew of it, I saw him there at the school, with his hair already cut like a schoolboy. All three of us were of the same band. We always went about together. Paul was my cross-cousin by clan because his clan was related to that of my father. He was also the son of my mother's half-sister's son. Because of this, our families always camped close together, and that is how I got to know him so well. Elton was of the same clan as Paul and so was also¬†[Page 496]¬†my cross-cousin. Whenever we traveled, Elton and his mother used to accompany us, as she was a great friend of my mother's.


Another boy whom I went about with a great deal was the younger brother of Henry Hudson. He was of my father's clan [also a cross-cousin]. There was a boy named Calvin I used to see a lot of. His father's clan and my father's clan were the same, so we were parallel cousins, but I didn't know he was my brother in this way until very much later.¬†nd√®Àôz√©`,¬†the boy who used to be the leader of the¬†g√°Àôn¬†dances, was also a parallel cousin of mine for the same reason. This I did not know until we had grown up. There were other boys we saw, but I saw most of the first four above. There must have been about twenty-five of us boys who played around together. We were of varying ages. We didn't always play together, but often split up to play in small groups because some would want to go one way, some another. Some days there wasn't anything doing at all, and at other times fathers wouldn't let their boys go off to play because they had work for them to do, such as going after the horses. But whenever we played at games such as scouts and renegades, or held a dance, all of us would be there.",NA,NA,https://ehrafworldcultures.yale.edu/sres/852d509b-4a16-4a8a-a3be-f480df52ad3f,33.86,-110.12,1942,5580,Play,Single

The material represents the period from 1893 to 1903. This, of course, was twenty years after the establishment of the San Carlos Reservation, when reservation life had settled into a groove of its own:


We children used to go to the edge of the river where the willows grew. There we made play wickiups of the willows and pretended to live as older people do. Boys and girls used to get married. Although we didn't exchange gifts such as horses at these marriages, we exchanged food and drink. The boy's family would prepare tulibai. There would be twenty-five mounds of earth piled up in a line, each representing one can of tulibai. The man whose daughter was to be married was invited to bring his family over to drink them. As each can was finished, the mound of earth was obliterated. A little later, the girl's family would prepare a great feast and invite the boy's family over. They had round¬†[Page 487]¬†flat pieces of limestone for the dishes and on each would be a different kind of make-believe food. When we got there, they would point out each kind to us, saying, ‚ÄúThis is walnuts; this is acorn meal and stewed meat.‚Äù


When a boy married, he never married his own sister. We knew about that. But we never thought about clan exogamy, and it didn't matter to us whether two children married who were of the same clan. We didn't pretend that they were of different clans. Also, we boys didn't avoid our own blood sisters, nor they us. We were too young for that. We didn't even pretend to avoid them. We began to think about that much later. We didn't joke our real cross-cousins then, either. We were too young.¬†24¬†


24In connection with a child's knowledge of social practices, Neil Buck once remarked, ‚ÄúAs a small boy I heard older people use the expression which signifies that a widow has been reclaimed in marriage by some kinsman of her dead husband. I used to wonder what it meant, and it was several years before I found out.‚Äù


A boy had to respect his parents-in-law and avoid his mother-in-law, so his camp was built at a little distance from that of his wife's parents. Though we called each other by our regular names in play when we wanted to, a man couldn't call the names of his parents-in-law, just as it is with grownups. He called them¬†c√†Àôd√†Àôn√≠`¬†[proper affinal term]. We had brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law whom we called¬†c√¨Œ≥√≠Àô¬†[proper affinal term] as well. We used to pretend that a man had obligations to his father-in-law. We had a play store, and he would have to go to the store all the time to buy things for his father-in-law. When we played family, we pretended we had children, but we never pretended that a woman was pregnant or that she gave birth to a baby. We didn't play that the youngest child was the favorite either, as it is among grownups.


I can remember one time when I was a small kid and we were playing family. One girl of the¬†n√°Œ≥√≤d√®sg√¨jn¬†clan was my mother. There were a lot of other small boys there. We made three or four little piles of dirt, calling them cans of tulibai. When we finished one can, we leveled the pile. Soon we all said we were drunk. I was my mother's only child, so I was alone. The other boys pretended to start a fight with me. They all jumped on me. The girl who was my mother hollered at the top of her lungs as a grown person would do, ‚ÄúThe¬†'√¨y√†`'√°iy‚ñ°¬†[clan] boys are fighting my son.‚Äù She shouted so loud that my real mother and older sister back at camp heard her. They used to laugh afterward when they told about it. But we didn't play at having clan blood-feuds. Maybe some children did, but then, you know, not all children play in the same way.


When we played at family and camp life, we did not pretend that one of us was chief and that others were wealthy, influential men, but we¬†[Page 488]¬†used to have police. When a man had tulibai, these police sometimes came around and caught him. Then the policeman would dump out the tulibai and arrest the man. The tulibai was muddy water. We had a place we pretended was the guardhouse, and the man would be put in there for three or four days. At this guardhouse food was given to the prisoners. We played at issuing rations also, just as they really did at the agency. The rations were issued to us by our police at the guardhouse. We used to ride to the guardhouse on willow sticks, which we said were horses, to receive our rations. The children would all line up in front of the guardhouse to get their rations. One policeman was detailed to watch the line and prevent any trouble which might arise, just as they really did at the agency, and a second issued the rations to us. We did not play school.


We didn't play at having cattle or burros or dogs, but we did play at horses. One boy would be sent out to drive the horses into camp. He would come in, bringing an armful of willow branches. These were the horses. Ration time would be coming round, so we would need the horses to ride in on to get rations. Men and their wives started off riding. If we had to stop on the way for the night, we tied our horses to a tree. Then we would pull up a few handfuls of grass and leave them there for the horse to eat, just as we had seen our elders do.


We boys also used to make wagons out of tin cans. That was before the railroad came through, and we used to see many teams go by on the way to San Carlos and Globe, hauling freight. They would camp along the road and leave tin cans. We made the wagons of these tin cans. We put the can in a fire and heated it until the solder at both ends melted, and the two round ends came loose. These we made into wheels, punching a hole through the centers for the axle. The rest of the tin we flattened out straight. Then we bent each edge down on the long sides. We punched other holes in the bent-down edges, so we could run sticks through for the axles and attach the wheels. We put two wheels in front and only one in back. Through the sides of the wagon bottom we struck upright poles to hold the loads on, just like a real wagon. Almost every boy had one of these. We used to pretend to haul loads of wood on them, lengths of greasewood about seven inches long. We hauled them to the store to sell to the storekeeper. Sometimes we boys played with the wagons by ourselves without girls, pretending that we were freighting. One boy would go ahead, the others following in a long line along the road, just as we had seen freighters go by. We were hauling to the store. When we played at home where the dogs were, we used to make believe they were horses, and pack loads on them. But the dogs would not follow us away from camp, so we had to use willow branches for horses elsewhere.


After we had been playing family and camps down by the river a¬†[Page 489]¬†while, one of the older boys would say he was going to be a white man and run a store. He would make a little inclosure by setting sticks up in the ground. This was the store. Inside, he used sticks to make a sort of shelf to put his goods on. He made things out of mud. These, and stones, were the store goods. The store was always about two hundred yards distant from our camps. When we went to the store to buy things, we used small stones for money. We didn't have any charge accounts.¬†25


25¬†Notice that the store is at a distance from the camp, just as it should be. Charge accounts are now the most common way of doing business, although they were less common in former times.


We never played at hunting large game such as deer, but all boys had bows and arrows and used to go out hunting small game. We really did it; we didn't play at it. We did not play at having farms and raising crops,





at going out to gather wild seeds and acorns, or at cooking mescal. That was the old way, but we had our store to buy food in. Girls used to cook mud in cans on a fire. That was our food. When we made a fire, we made a very small one because our play wickiups were small. A few boys had those small, old-fashioned matches, but the rest of us had to get our fire at home and carry it down to where we played.


Older boys made knives out of tin cans. Only boys, not girls, did this. The knife was made by bending a piece of tin about the end of a stick, so that it stayed in place. One end of the stick served as a handle. The blade was curved and ground to an edge. The older boys who had these knives always carried them in their pockets, so that if they were out hunting and broke an arrow they could fashion another. They always had a pocketful of all kinds of birds' feathers, as well as sinew, so that they could repair or make new arrows at any time.


Boys, not girls, used to pretend to smoke. We would go along the riverbanks where the water had exposed the dry, pithy root of a cottonwood. We smoked sections of this just like a cigar, and in our store the storekeeper had them for sale. We used to take only a few puffs on them and throw them away. We also dried the leaves of¬†tc'√≠≈Çt'√≤j√©`¬†[‚Äúone sucks it‚Äù (sour dock)] and kept them in a little sack. We rolled cigarettes with these, using the paper from sugar or coffee packages which we picked up at home. Our families did not scold us for doing this. We didn't make ropes to play with. The girls used to make dolls. Little girls made dolls by bundling old rags together and tying them around the middle. Sometimes they made the hair of shredded cloth. We didn't paint our faces, but we used to tattoo marks on our skin‚Äîjust marks, not letters. We put them on our wrists, hands, and faces.


[Page 490]


Sometimes we played at having a social dance. We made a little drum out of a tin can. We put some water inside and stretched a piece of cloth across the mouth, tying it there. There would be a whole crowd of children, just like big people gathered at a dance. The boys would sing and sometimes the little girls would sing also. We sang old CJ37's songs, his lightning songs.¬†26¬†


26¬†CJ37 was a very powerful lightning shaman in the community.


Some of the little boys would tell the little girls to go out and start dancing. They would, several of them dancing back and forth together to the music. Then the boys would tell them to dance¬†≈Ç√†d√†tc'√¨tc'√πc¬†[a type of social dance], and the little girls would pick partners from among the boys to dance with them. Most of these children were from six to eight years old. Older children didn't take part in it. We danced in the daytime, right beside our own homes.


We never played at having a puberty ceremony for a girl, at holding curing ceremonies for sick people, at giving a hunting ceremony, or at singing deer, snake, or other such sacred songs. But we did play at giving the¬†g√°Àôn¬†dance and social dances. One boy called¬†nd√®Àôz√©`¬†[‚Äútall one‚Äù] was the leader in our community in any play of this sort. I guess he did not wish to play at curing rites or hunting ceremonies, or we might have done it. As he took the initiative in such things, we merely followed him. He was about sixteen at the time all this happened, and I must have been around ten. Some of the other boys were big boys, fourteen and fifteen years old.¬†nd√®Àôz√©`¬†is still living at Fort Apache. He used to pretend he was the father of John Roberson [a famous¬†g√°Àôn¬†shaman at that time] and knew all the¬†g√°Àôn¬†power. He made small¬†g√°Àôn¬†masks for us to wear from the left-over pieces when the men made real¬†g√°Àôn¬†masks for a ceremony. They were of the sotol stalk. We gave these¬†g√°Àôn¬†dances at night. We didn't even pretend to be curing anyone, but just gave them to have the dance.¬†nd√®Àôz√©`¬†himself painted the boys who were going to dance as¬†g√°Àôn.¬†When John Roberson's father used to paint his own dancers, at the end he put a dot of white paint on each of his cheeks and then ran the ends of his fingers dipped in white paint down the backs of his hands in a zigzag. So this boy used to do the same thing. Then he walked out to where we had the fire and called out¬†h√†g√∫Àô, h√†g√∫Àô,¬†just as John Roberson's father did. This was a signal for the impersonators to make their entry.


We used to hold this dance not far from our own homes.¬†nd√®Àôz√©`¬†sang for us. He sang real¬†g√°Àôn¬†songs, ones belonging to this same¬†g√°Àôn¬†shaman which he had picked up from hearing him sing them. He used to have a regular-sized drum made from a large can. He always brought it out when we had a dance. I don't know where he kept it. After the¬†g√°Àôn¬†dance was finished, we would have the circle dance.¬†27¬†


27¬†This customarily follows the completion of the¬†g√°Àôn¬†dance.


After the¬†[Page 491]¬†circle dance, we danced¬†≈Ç√®d√†tc'√¨tc'√πc.¬†Sometimes it used to turn into a real big dance, older youths and maidens coming down and joining in, helping to carry it through. We younger boys and girls would social dance also. Little girls walked up to a boy and touched him on the shoulder, inviting him to dance, just like grownups. But when only we younger children were playing at it, the dance petered out after a while. We would get tired of it. For the social dancing,¬†nd√®Àôz√©`¬†and some of the rest of us boys sang lightning songs, ones that belonged to the old man, CJ37. He knew we used them, but he didn't seem to mind. When the dance was finished, we put the¬†g√°Àôn¬†masks away in the brush for the night. The next morning we would conceal them where no one could find them, just as a real¬†g√°Àôn¬†shaman would do with his masks. Grownups didn't come to watch these dances of ours. They didn't seem to bother particularly about them, though sometimes our parents would tell us not to do it any more. But you know how kids are. They don't always obey their parents. We kept it up.


John Roberson's father used to give his¬†g√°Àôn¬†dance at almost every girl's puberty ceremony. After the ceremony he put the masks away in a cave across the river, not so far from where we lived. Other shamans who had ceremonial articles to be put away used the same cave. There was a great deal of ceremonial material in this cave.¬†28¬†


28¬†Such ceremonial objects, once put away, are never used again. It would be very dangerous to disturb them.


Sometimes when just we boys were off in the hills during the daytime, without any girls, we would go to this cave, take the masks out, put them on, and pretend to dance. This was under the leadership of¬†nd√®Àôz√©`.¬†But we never touched the hoops or crosses of the lightning shamans which were there. We were afraid of them.¬†29¬†


29¬†Lightning is the most dreaded of all supernatural forces.


We fooled around with the masks for an hour or so and then put them back and went on our way.¬†30¬†


30¬†The same thing was recorded for aboriginal times.


One time, I and some other boys went past this cave.¬†nd√®Àôz√©`,¬†who was with us, said, ‚ÄúCome on, let's have a dance.‚Äù We got the masks out, and he put them on us and painted us all up. We made dancing kilts by wrapping our shirts about our waists. Then he told us to wait there, that he was going off a little way, and, when he gave the call and started to sing, to come out and dance. We stood there, waiting. We waited and waited, but he did not call. Finally he took off the masks and went to see what was the matter. He was not there. He had played a joke and run off and left us. Not long after this, John Roberson's father must have found out what we boys had been doing. He must have dreamed about it, for he said, ‚ÄúSome boy is doing the same way I do.‚Äù He meant that someone had been using his masks.¬†[Page 492]¬†He was angry. But he didn't mind us children making our own small masks and putting on dances at home in which we used his songs. Later on, when¬†nd√®Àôz√©`¬†grew up, this same¬†g√°Àôn¬†shaman used him as a real¬†g√°Àôn¬†dancer. He was a very good one and danced many times, but he never became a¬†g√°Àôn¬†shaman.


There are no children's songs. The only songs that children sing are ones they hear grownups sing. I first started to sing when I was about six or seven. I sang a few songs such as the lightning songs of CJ37, but I only knew parts, not the whole song. I also was able to sing snatches of love songs that I had heard, but I couldn't sing any social dance songs. They were too hard. All of us kids would try to sing parts of such songs as these, but it wasn't until I was about ten that I first really started to learn whole songs. Old CJ37 often sang all night at curing or other ceremonies. He sang lightning songs and medicine songs, as well as others. We boys weren't meant to attend these ceremonies, but we did. The first song I learned to sing was a lightning song. We used to go to the curing ceremonies of CJ13, another shaman. He had all kinds of power for curing sicknesses: snake power, bear power, and others. From hearing these songs sung, we boys learned them. We could not sing the words, but we could sing the choruses. We used to try out one song at our play dances and sing it over and over again until we finally learned it. Then we would learn another and start using it.


We did not play at death and burial. We never did. I don't think it was because we were afraid of it. It was mainly because we never thought about playing that way. Besides, we didn't have the amount of sickness and death then that we have had since.


By the time I was old enough to join in the boys' war game [after eleven or twelve], boys had ceased playing it. But when I was a small boy, not yet old enough to join in, I can remember older boys playing it. Down at Dewey Flats, the Eastern White Mountain camps were on one side of the river, the Western White Mountain camps on the other. The boys from each side played this game against one another. They fought with slings and stones. The Yavapai, camped on the river below us, fought the Arivaipa boys near them in the same way. Big boys and sometimes men took part. Once I was swimming in the river with another small boy. We had no clothes on. A Yavapai youth came along and slung a stone at us. We got up and ran. We tried to throw rocks at him, but missed. We escaped into some thick brush and lay there. He could not see us but slung a stone blindly into the thicket. It hit me right on the buttocks. Years later I met this Yavapai as a man. We talked about that time and laughed.


When I was a boy of ten or so, I used to pretend to play at ‚Äúhidden-ball‚Äù with other boys my age. We didn't play with moccasins but hid¬†[Page 493]¬†the ball in the ground. We learned this game from the San Carlos people. We used to go and watch grown men playing it, for they played it not far from the camps. That's how we learned it. After watching a game among the men, boys were likely to start one of their own the next day. We played either during the day or at night, sometimes inside the wickiup. But we just played a little while and then quit. We would bet arrows and marbles with each other. Little girls came and watched us, just like women do at a real game, but they never played. When I was older, I and other boys my age played at hoop-and-poles. But until boys were about fifteen years old they never played this game. It was a man's game. I can remember when I and two friends of mine played it. We had a set of poles made of batamota, and our hoop was of mesquite root. Sometimes, boys made their hoop-and-poles of willow. A boy who owned a set always took it home with him at night after the game, just as a man would do. We had lots of fun playing at this game. There would be a whole lot of boys, just as there were many men about a hoop-and-poles course when they played. We knew exactly how to play it, and our hoops had ‚Äúbig bead‚Äù in the middle, with fifty beads, sometimes sixty-one beads, on each side.¬†31¬†


31¬†Beads are the coils about a cord tied across the diameter of the hoop. They are used in scoring.


We gambled, betting our marbles and tops, but we never pretended to have gambling power for this game. We didn't know about that. Boys weren't allowed to use a real set of hoop-and-poles for fear they would damage them. Just as no women or girls were allowed around when men played hoop-and-poles, we boys didn't let any girls come where we were playing.


Up to ten years old or so boys and girls very often played together, but after eleven or twelve they separated. The sort of play I have told you about [all the preceding, excluding the hoop-and-poles game, the play with the real¬†g√°Àôn¬†masks, and the boy's war game] was mainly girls and boys together. Boys alone didn't play at family, marriage, cooking, making wickiups, or rations. After a boy was eleven or twelve, he spent most of his time going about in groups with other boys, hunting birds and small animals, sometimes all day and even at night, or playing certain boy's games which I will tell you about. Girls played separately from big boys after this age also. Many girls played until they were fifteen or so. They made wickiups just as we did when younger, but these were larger and better made, about six feet high. Inside they played at household with little children, both boys and girls, though these little kids were just there mainly to watch them. That's the way small children learn to play. The big girls would play at cooking. They didn't pretend mud was their food, the way small children do, but they boiled water, pretending it was tulibai and such things. They used to¬†[Page [facing p.494]]





[Page 494]¬†make dolls, really good ones, and clothe them in girl's dresses which they sewed. They made the hair of real hair so that it hung down the back. They made miniature moccasins of buckskin for them. They knew how to make good dolls.


We big boys used to hunt kangaroo rats out in the brush at night-time. We didn't eat them. We just killed them. One time a bunch of us boys went across the river from Dewey Flats and killed a whole sackful. There was an old woman living near by who was so old that she was in her second childhood. She spent most of her time asleep. That night we crept into her wickiup and put the sack of rats at the side of her bed as she slept. She slept with the kangaroo rats all night, not knowing it. Next morning I guess she was mad when she found out. Sometimes we boys hunted quail at night. We crossed back and forth across the Gila River as many as two and three times in a night doing this, even in wintertime. I and one of my cross-cousins were out like this one night. We thought we saw a duck in the river. We shot at it. It was just an old stick. We lost our arrow and so we built a fire and made another one by its light. At other times we went up toward Turn-bull Mountain, where there were many cactus plants growing. The quail roosted on these, and we killed them. Sometimes three or four of us would ride burros out into the hills to shoot doves during their nesting season. They were easy to hit when they sat on the nest. When we went out in the hills to hunt, the oldest boy was always the leader. We went where he said. When we killed birds, sometimes we would stop and cook and eat them.


We used to play at renegades and soldiers. CJ30 played with us. He was a lot older than the rest of us. He always used to take the part of Apache Kid, and one other boy always took the part of a Chiricahua renegade. The rest of us were soldiers and scouts and would try to capture these two. There were two hills where we usually played this game. The renegades would come out on the side of one hill and holler at us. Then they would come out on the other side of the hill and shout. We used horse manure as bullets. If you got hit by one of these bullets, you were dead right there. For our captain we had one lame boy. There were boys older than he who could have been captain, but we made him captain because he could not travel fast and was always in the rear.¬†32¬†


32¬†Old scouts often speak of how their white officers were unable to keep up with them on foot during campaigns against hostile Apache.


We always played this game at night. One evening when we were playing we saw a man coming riding toward us. We could see the glint of his rifle barrel in the moonlight. It was only the older brother of Elton Causey coming home from a party, but, thinking it was really Apache Kid, we got scared and all ran off. Our captain was left behind. He hollered at us. Later, the same evening, the oldest¬†[Page [facing p. 495]]





[Page 495]¬†boys among us went up to where some white men, freighting with wagons, had camped for the night. They crept into the camp and stole some biscuits out of a dutch oven. They took a can of salt too. They brought this back to where the rest of us were waiting. We split the biscuits up between us, put salt on them, and ate them. Each one of us got one. This was to feed us soldiers. The white men must have been very sound asleep. The next morning a white man from the camp climbed up on top of a hill where he could overlook our camps. He thought we had taken the biscuits, but he didn't say anything.


One time I, Charley Sago,¬†nd√®Àôz√©`,¬†and some other boys went down river to where the Yavapai were living. We hung about all day. We saw that the Yavapai had a lot of good melons in their fields. We waited until night and then went into the fields and ate our fill of them. We gathered more melons and took them up to where some Mexican freighters were camped on the road. They gave us a meal and some sugar and coffee in exchange for the melons. We left, and after we had gone a little way we could hear the Mexicans commence to shout. We thought that the Yavapai must have found the Mexicans with their melons and that they would soon be on our trail. We ran for it. After a while we heard someone coming on horseback, so we split up. It was too dark to see. When the rider was close, one of the boys hollered, ‚ÄúHello.‚Äù The man answered ‚ÄúHello‚Äù and went on. After going a way farther, we stopped and built a fire to warm ourselves. From there we went to our homes. When I got home, I found mother telling stories with an old woman. That's the way old women used to do. They had cooked up some corn and were eating it. I had some of the coffee and sugar tied in the corner of my shirt. Mother asked me where I got it, and I told her that the Mexicans had given it to me. But I really got it for the melons I had stolen.


I can't remember the children that I played with before I was ten, but from then on, until I went off to school at fourteen, my two best friends were Paul Nosey and Elton Causey. The first died in school.¬†33¬†


33¬†The second boy mentioned was not a close friend of the narrator's in adult life.


The second didn't go to school at the same time I did, but not long after that mother told me he went to our camp and lay down on my bed and told her, ‚ÄúWell, I guess I'll go to school also.‚Äù He didn't have to go, but he wanted to be with me. The first I knew of it, I saw him there at the school, with his hair already cut like a schoolboy. All three of us were of the same band. We always went about together. Paul was my cross-cousin by clan because his clan was related to that of my father. He was also the son of my mother's half-sister's son. Because of this, our families always camped close together, and that is how I got to know him so well. Elton was of the same clan as Paul and so was also¬†[Page 496]¬†my cross-cousin. Whenever we traveled, Elton and his mother used to accompany us, as she was a great friend of my mother's.


Another boy whom I went about with a great deal was the younger brother of Henry Hudson. He was of my father's clan [also a cross-cousin]. There was a boy named Calvin I used to see a lot of. His father's clan and my father's clan were the same, so we were parallel cousins, but I didn't know he was my brother in this way until very much later.¬†nd√®Àôz√©`,¬†the boy who used to be the leader of the¬†g√°Àôn¬†dances, was also a parallel cousin of mine for the same reason. This I did not know until we had grown up. There were other boys we saw, but I saw most of the first four above. There must have been about twenty-five of us boys who played around together. We were of varying ages. We didn't always play together, but often split up to play in small groups because some would want to go one way, some another. Some days there wasn't anything doing at all, and at other times fathers wouldn't let their boys go off to play because they had work for them to do, such as going after the horses. But whenever we played at games such as scouts and renegades, or held a dance, all of us would be there.",NA,NA,https://ehrafworldcultures.yale.edu/sres/852d509b-4a16-4a8a-a3be-f480df52ad3f,33.86,-110.12,1942,5580,Play,Single

The material represents the period from 1893 to 1903. This, of course, was twenty years after the establishment of the San Carlos Reservation, when reservation life had settled into a groove of its own:


We children used to go to the edge of the river where the willows grew. There we made play wickiups of the willows and pretended to live as older people do. Boys and girls used to get married. Although we didn't exchange gifts such as horses at these marriages, we exchanged food and drink. The boy's family would prepare tulibai. There would be twenty-five mounds of earth piled up in a line, each representing one can of tulibai. The man whose daughter was to be married was invited to bring his family over to drink them. As each can was finished, the mound of earth was obliterated. A little later, the girl's family would prepare a great feast and invite the boy's family over. They had round¬†[Page 487]¬†flat pieces of limestone for the dishes and on each would be a different kind of make-believe food. When we got there, they would point out each kind to us, saying, ‚ÄúThis is walnuts; this is acorn meal and stewed meat.‚Äù


When a boy married, he never married his own sister. We knew about that. But we never thought about clan exogamy, and it didn't matter to us whether two children married who were of the same clan. We didn't pretend that they were of different clans. Also, we boys didn't avoid our own blood sisters, nor they us. We were too young for that. We didn't even pretend to avoid them. We began to think about that much later. We didn't joke our real cross-cousins then, either. We were too young.¬†24¬†





A boy had to respect his parents-in-law and avoid his mother-in-law, so his camp was built at a little distance from that of his wife's parents. Though we called each other by our regular names in play when we wanted to, a man couldn't call the names of his parents-in-law, just as it is with grownups. He called them¬†c√†Àôd√†Àôn√≠`¬†[proper affinal term]. We had brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law whom we called¬†c√¨Œ≥√≠Àô¬†[proper affinal term] as well. We used to pretend that a man had obligations to his father-in-law. We had a play store, and he would have to go to the store all the time to buy things for his father-in-law. When we played family, we pretended we had children, but we never pretended that a woman was pregnant or that she gave birth to a baby. We didn't play that the youngest child was the favorite either, as it is among grownups.


I can remember one time when I was a small kid and we were playing family. One girl of the¬†n√°Œ≥√≤d√®sg√¨jn¬†clan was my mother. There were a lot of other small boys there. We made three or four little piles of dirt, calling them cans of tulibai. When we finished one can, we leveled the pile. Soon we all said we were drunk. I was my mother's only child, so I was alone. The other boys pretended to start a fight with me. They all jumped on me. The girl who was my mother hollered at the top of her lungs as a grown person would do, ‚ÄúThe¬†'√¨y√†`'√°iy‚ñ°¬†[clan] boys are fighting my son.‚Äù She shouted so loud that my real mother and older sister back at camp heard her. They used to laugh afterward when they told about it. But we didn't play at having clan blood-feuds. Maybe some children did, but then, you know, not all children play in the same way.





When we played at family and camp life, we did not pretend that one of us was chief and that others were wealthy, influential men, but we¬†[Page 488]¬†used to have police. When a man had tulibai, these police sometimes came around and caught him. Then the policeman would dump out the tulibai and arrest the man. The tulibai was muddy water. We had a place we pretended was the guardhouse, and the man would be put in there for three or four days. At this guardhouse food was given to the prisoners. We played at issuing rations also, just as they really did at the agency. The rations were issued to us by our police at the guardhouse. We used to ride to the guardhouse on willow sticks, which we said were horses, to receive our rations. The children would all line up in front of the guardhouse to get their rations. One policeman was detailed to watch the line and prevent any trouble which might arise, just as they really did at the agency, and a second issued the rations to us. We did not play school.


We didn't play at having cattle or burros or dogs, but we did play at horses. One boy would be sent out to drive the horses into camp. He would come in, bringing an armful of willow branches. These were the horses. Ration time would be coming round, so we would need the horses to ride in on to get rations. Men and their wives started off riding. If we had to stop on the way for the night, we tied our horses to a tree. Then we would pull up a few handfuls of grass and leave them there for the horse to eat, just as we had seen our elders do.


We boys also used to make wagons out of tin cans. That was before the railroad came through, and we used to see many teams go by on the way to San Carlos and Globe, hauling freight. They would camp along the road and leave tin cans. We made the wagons of these tin cans. We put the can in a fire and heated it until the solder at both ends melted, and the two round ends came loose. These we made into wheels, punching a hole through the centers for the axle. The rest of the tin we flattened out straight. Then we bent each edge down on the long sides. We punched other holes in the bent-down edges, so we could run sticks through for the axles and attach the wheels. We put two wheels in front and only one in back. Through the sides of the wagon bottom we struck upright poles to hold the loads on, just like a real wagon. Almost every boy had one of these. We used to pretend to haul loads of wood on them, lengths of greasewood about seven inches long. We hauled them to the store to sell to the storekeeper. Sometimes we boys played with the wagons by ourselves without girls, pretending that we were freighting. One boy would go ahead, the others following in a long line along the road, just as we had seen freighters go by. We were hauling to the store. When we played at home where the dogs were, we used to make believe they were horses, and pack loads on them. But the dogs would not follow us away from camp, so we had to use willow branches for horses elsewhere.


After we had been playing family and camps down by the river a¬†[Page 489]¬†while, one of the older boys would say he was going to be a white man and run a store. He would make a little inclosure by setting sticks up in the ground. This was the store. Inside, he used sticks to make a sort of shelf to put his goods on. He made things out of mud. These, and stones, were the store goods. The store was always about two hundred yards distant from our camps. When we went to the store to buy things, we used small stones for money. We didn't have any charge accounts.¬†25


We never played at hunting large game such as deer, but all boys had bows and arrows and used to go out hunting small game. We really did it; we didn't play at it. We did not play at having farms and raising crops,


BOY'S KNIFE


at going out to gather wild seeds and acorns, or at cooking mescal. That was the old way, but we had our store to buy food in. Girls used to cook mud in cans on a fire. That was our food. When we made a fire, we made a very small one because our play wickiups were small. A few boys had those small, old-fashioned matches, but the rest of us had to get our fire at home and carry it down to where we played.


Older boys made knives out of tin cans. Only boys, not girls, did this. The knife was made by bending a piece of tin about the end of a stick, so that it stayed in place. One end of the stick served as a handle. The blade was curved and ground to an edge. The older boys who had these knives always carried them in their pockets, so that if they were out hunting and broke an arrow they could fashion another. They always had a pocketful of all kinds of birds' feathers, as well as sinew, so that they could repair or make new arrows at any time.


Boys, not girls, used to pretend to smoke. We would go along the riverbanks where the water had exposed the dry, pithy root of a cottonwood. We smoked sections of this just like a cigar, and in our store the storekeeper had them for sale. We used to take only a few puffs on them and throw them away. We also dried the leaves of¬†tc'√≠≈Çt'√≤j√©`¬†[‚Äúone sucks it‚Äù (sour dock)] and kept them in a little sack. We rolled cigarettes with these, using the paper from sugar or coffee packages which we picked up at home. Our families did not scold us for doing this. We didn't make ropes to play with. The girls used to make dolls. Little girls made dolls by bundling old rags together and tying them around the middle. Sometimes they made the hair of shredded cloth. We didn't paint our faces, but we used to tattoo marks on our skin‚Äîjust marks, not letters. We put them on our wrists, hands, and faces.


[Page 490]


Sometimes we played at having a social dance. We made a little drum out of a tin can. We put some water inside and stretched a piece of cloth across the mouth, tying it there. There would be a whole crowd of children, just like big people gathered at a dance. The boys would sing and sometimes the little girls would sing also. We sang old CJ37's songs, his lightning songs.¬†26¬†


Some of the little boys would tell the little girls to go out and start dancing. They would, several of them dancing back and forth together to the music. Then the boys would tell them to dance¬†≈Ç√†d√†tc'√¨tc'√πc¬†[a type of social dance], and the little girls would pick partners from among the boys to dance with them. Most of these children were from six to eight years old. Older children didn't take part in it. We danced in the daytime, right beside our own homes.


We never played at having a puberty ceremony for a girl, at holding curing ceremonies for sick people, at giving a hunting ceremony, or at singing deer, snake, or other such sacred songs. But we did play at giving the¬†g√°Àôn¬†dance and social dances. One boy called¬†nd√®Àôz√©`¬†[‚Äútall one‚Äù] was the leader in our community in any play of this sort. I guess he did not wish to play at curing rites or hunting ceremonies, or we might have done it. As he took the initiative in such things, we merely followed him. He was about sixteen at the time all this happened, and I must have been around ten. Some of the other boys were big boys, fourteen and fifteen years old.¬†nd√®Àôz√©`¬†is still living at Fort Apache. He used to pretend he was the father of John Roberson [a famous¬†g√°Àôn¬†shaman at that time] and knew all the¬†g√°Àôn¬†power. He made small¬†g√°Àôn¬†masks for us to wear from the left-over pieces when the men made real¬†g√°Àôn¬†masks for a ceremony. They were of the sotol stalk. We gave these¬†g√°Àôn¬†dances at night. We didn't even pretend to be curing anyone, but just gave them to have the dance.¬†nd√®Àôz√©`¬†himself painted the boys who were going to dance as¬†g√°Àôn.¬†When John Roberson's father used to paint his own dancers, at the end he put a dot of white paint on each of his cheeks and then ran the ends of his fingers dipped in white paint down the backs of his hands in a zigzag. So this boy used to do the same thing. Then he walked out to where we had the fire and called out¬†h√†g√∫Àô, h√†g√∫Àô,¬†just as John Roberson's father did. This was a signal for the impersonators to make their entry.


We used to hold this dance not far from our own homes.¬†nd√®Àôz√©`¬†sang for us. He sang real¬†g√°Àôn¬†songs, ones belonging to this same¬†g√°Àôn¬†shaman which he had picked up from hearing him sing them. He used to have a regular-sized drum made from a large can. He always brought it out when we had a dance. I don't know where he kept it. After the¬†g√°Àôn¬†dance was finished, we would have the circle dance.¬†27¬†


After the¬†[Page 491]¬†circle dance, we danced¬†≈Ç√®d√†tc'√¨tc'√πc.¬†Sometimes it used to turn into a real big dance, older youths and maidens coming down and joining in, helping to carry it through. We younger boys and girls would social dance also. Little girls walked up to a boy and touched him on the shoulder, inviting him to dance, just like grownups. But when only we younger children were playing at it, the dance petered out after a while. We would get tired of it. For the social dancing,¬†nd√®Àôz√©`¬†and some of the rest of us boys sang lightning songs, ones that belonged to the old man, CJ37. He knew we used them, but he didn't seem to mind. When the dance was finished, we put the¬†g√°Àôn¬†masks away in the brush for the night. The next morning we would conceal them where no one could find them, just as a real¬†g√°Àôn¬†shaman would do with his masks. Grownups didn't come to watch these dances of ours. They didn't seem to bother particularly about them, though sometimes our parents would tell us not to do it any more. But you know how kids are. They don't always obey their parents. We kept it up.


John Roberson's father used to give his¬†g√°Àôn¬†dance at almost every girl's puberty ceremony. After the ceremony he put the masks away in a cave across the river, not so far from where we lived. Other shamans who had ceremonial articles to be put away used the same cave. There was a great deal of ceremonial material in this cave.¬†28¬†


Sometimes when just we boys were off in the hills during the daytime, without any girls, we would go to this cave, take the masks out, put them on, and pretend to dance. This was under the leadership of¬†nd√®Àôz√©`.¬†But we never touched the hoops or crosses of the lightning shamans which were there. We were afraid of them.¬†29¬†


We fooled around with the masks for an hour or so and then put them back and went on our way.¬†30¬†





One time, I and some other boys went past this cave.¬†nd√®Àôz√©`,¬†who was with us, said, ‚ÄúCome on, let's have a dance.‚Äù We got the masks out, and he put them on us and painted us all up. We made dancing kilts by wrapping our shirts about our waists. Then he told us to wait there, that he was going off a little way, and, when he gave the call and started to sing, to come out and dance. We stood there, waiting. We waited and waited, but he did not call. Finally he took off the masks and went to see what was the matter. He was not there. He had played a joke and run off and left us. Not long after this, John Roberson's father must have found out what we boys had been doing. He must have dreamed about it, for he said, ‚ÄúSome boy is doing the same way I do.‚Äù He meant that someone had been using his masks.¬†[Page 492]¬†He was angry. But he didn't mind us children making our own small masks and putting on dances at home in which we used his songs. Later on, when¬†nd√®Àôz√©`¬†grew up, this same¬†g√°Àôn¬†shaman used him as a real¬†g√°Àôn¬†dancer. He was a very good one and danced many times, but he never became a¬†g√°Àôn¬†shaman.


There are no children's songs. The only songs that children sing are ones they hear grownups sing. I first started to sing when I was about six or seven. I sang a few songs such as the lightning songs of CJ37, but I only knew parts, not the whole song. I also was able to sing snatches of love songs that I had heard, but I couldn't sing any social dance songs. They were too hard. All of us kids would try to sing parts of such songs as these, but it wasn't until I was about ten that I first really started to learn whole songs. Old CJ37 often sang all night at curing or other ceremonies. He sang lightning songs and medicine songs, as well as others. We boys weren't meant to attend these ceremonies, but we did. The first song I learned to sing was a lightning song. We used to go to the curing ceremonies of CJ13, another shaman. He had all kinds of power for curing sicknesses: snake power, bear power, and others. From hearing these songs sung, we boys learned them. We could not sing the words, but we could sing the choruses. We used to try out one song at our play dances and sing it over and over again until we finally learned it. Then we would learn another and start using it.


We did not play at death and burial. We never did. I don't think it was because we were afraid of it. It was mainly because we never thought about playing that way. Besides, we didn't have the amount of sickness and death then that we have had since.


By the time I was old enough to join in the boys' war game [after eleven or twelve], boys had ceased playing it. But when I was a small boy, not yet old enough to join in, I can remember older boys playing it. Down at Dewey Flats, the Eastern White Mountain camps were on one side of the river, the Western White Mountain camps on the other. The boys from each side played this game against one another. They fought with slings and stones. The Yavapai, camped on the river below us, fought the Arivaipa boys near them in the same way. Big boys and sometimes men took part. Once I was swimming in the river with another small boy. We had no clothes on. A Yavapai youth came along and slung a stone at us. We got up and ran. We tried to throw rocks at him, but missed. We escaped into some thick brush and lay there. He could not see us but slung a stone blindly into the thicket. It hit me right on the buttocks. Years later I met this Yavapai as a man. We talked about that time and laughed.


When I was a boy of ten or so, I used to pretend to play at ‚Äúhidden-ball‚Äù with other boys my age. We didn't play with moccasins but hid¬†[Page 493]¬†the ball in the ground. We learned this game from the San Carlos people. We used to go and watch grown men playing it, for they played it not far from the camps. That's how we learned it. After watching a game among the men, boys were likely to start one of their own the next day. We played either during the day or at night, sometimes inside the wickiup. But we just played a little while and then quit. We would bet arrows and marbles with each other. Little girls came and watched us, just like women do at a real game, but they never played. When I was older, I and other boys my age played at hoop-and-poles. But until boys were about fifteen years old they never played this game. It was a man's game. I can remember when I and two friends of mine played it. We had a set of poles made of batamota, and our hoop was of mesquite root. Sometimes, boys made their hoop-and-poles of willow. A boy who owned a set always took it home with him at night after the game, just as a man would do. We had lots of fun playing at this game. There would be a whole lot of boys, just as there were many men about a hoop-and-poles course when they played. We knew exactly how to play it, and our hoops had ‚Äúbig bead‚Äù in the middle, with fifty beads, sometimes sixty-one beads, on each side.¬†31¬†


We gambled, betting our marbles and tops, but we never pretended to have gambling power for this game. We didn't know about that. Boys weren't allowed to use a real set of hoop-and-poles for fear they would damage them. Just as no women or girls were allowed around when men played hoop-and-poles, we boys didn't let any girls come where we were playing.


Up to ten years old or so boys and girls very often played together, but after eleven or twelve they separated. The sort of play I have told you about [all the preceding, excluding the hoop-and-poles game, the play with the real¬†g√°Àôn¬†masks, and the boy's war game] was mainly girls and boys together. Boys alone didn't play at family, marriage, cooking, making wickiups, or rations. After a boy was eleven or twelve, he spent most of his time going about in groups with other boys, hunting birds and small animals, sometimes all day and even at night, or playing certain boy's games which I will tell you about. Girls played separately from big boys after this age also. Many girls played until they were fifteen or so. They made wickiups just as we did when younger, but these were larger and better made, about six feet high. Inside they played at household with little children, both boys and girls, though these little kids were just there mainly to watch them. That's the way small children learn to play. The big girls would play at cooking. They didn't pretend mud was their food, the way small children do, but they boiled water, pretending it was tulibai and such things. They used to¬†[Page [facing p.494]]


PLATE VIII


PLAYING AT COOKING


[Page 494]¬†make dolls, really good ones, and clothe them in girl's dresses which they sewed. They made the hair of real hair so that it hung down the back. They made miniature moccasins of buckskin for them. They knew how to make good dolls.


We big boys used to hunt kangaroo rats out in the brush at night-time. We didn't eat them. We just killed them. One time a bunch of us boys went across the river from Dewey Flats and killed a whole sackful. There was an old woman living near by who was so old that she was in her second childhood. She spent most of her time asleep. That night we crept into her wickiup and put the sack of rats at the side of her bed as she slept. She slept with the kangaroo rats all night, not knowing it. Next morning I guess she was mad when she found out. Sometimes we boys hunted quail at night. We crossed back and forth across the Gila River as many as two and three times in a night doing this, even in wintertime. I and one of my cross-cousins were out like this one night. We thought we saw a duck in the river. We shot at it. It was just an old stick. We lost our arrow and so we built a fire and made another one by its light. At other times we went up toward Turn-bull Mountain, where there were many cactus plants growing. The quail roosted on these, and we killed them. Sometimes three or four of us would ride burros out into the hills to shoot doves during their nesting season. They were easy to hit when they sat on the nest. When we went out in the hills to hunt, the oldest boy was always the leader. We went where he said. When we killed birds, sometimes we would stop and cook and eat them.


We used to play at renegades and soldiers. CJ30 played with us. He was a lot older than the rest of us. He always used to take the part of Apache Kid, and one other boy always took the part of a Chiricahua renegade. The rest of us were soldiers and scouts and would try to capture these two. There were two hills where we usually played this game. The renegades would come out on the side of one hill and holler at us. Then they would come out on the other side of the hill and shout. We used horse manure as bullets. If you got hit by one of these bullets, you were dead right there. For our captain we had one lame boy. There were boys older than he who could have been captain, but we made him captain because he could not travel fast and was always in the rear.¬†32¬†





We always played this game at night. One evening when we were playing we saw a man coming riding toward us. We could see the glint of his rifle barrel in the moonlight. It was only the older brother of Elton Causey coming home from a party, but, thinking it was really Apache Kid, we got scared and all ran off. Our captain was left behind. He hollered at us. Later, the same evening, the oldest¬†[Page [facing p. 495]]


PLATE IX


CHILDREN AT PLAY


[Page 495]¬†boys among us went up to where some white men, freighting with wagons, had camped for the night. They crept into the camp and stole some biscuits out of a dutch oven. They took a can of salt too. They brought this back to where the rest of us were waiting. We split the biscuits up between us, put salt on them, and ate them. Each one of us got one. This was to feed us soldiers. The white men must have been very sound asleep. The next morning a white man from the camp climbed up on top of a hill where he could overlook our camps. He thought we had taken the biscuits, but he didn't say anything.


One time I, Charley Sago,¬†nd√®Àôz√©`,¬†and some other boys went down river to where the Yavapai were living. We hung about all day. We saw that the Yavapai had a lot of good melons in their fields. We waited until night and then went into the fields and ate our fill of them. We gathered more melons and took them up to where some Mexican freighters were camped on the road. They gave us a meal and some sugar and coffee in exchange for the melons. We left, and after we had gone a little way we could hear the Mexicans commence to shout. We thought that the Yavapai must have found the Mexicans with their melons and that they would soon be on our trail. We ran for it. After a while we heard someone coming on horseback, so we split up. It was too dark to see. When the rider was close, one of the boys hollered, ‚ÄúHello.‚Äù The man answered ‚ÄúHello‚Äù and went on. After going a way farther, we stopped and built a fire to warm ourselves. From there we went to our homes. When I got home, I found mother telling stories with an old woman. That's the way old women used to do. They had cooked up some corn and were eating it. I had some of the coffee and sugar tied in the corner of my shirt. Mother asked me where I got it, and I told her that the Mexicans had given it to me. But I really got it for the melons I had stolen.


I can't remember the children that I played with before I was ten, but from then on, until I went off to school at fourteen, my two best friends were Paul Nosey and Elton Causey. The first died in school.¬†33¬†


The second didn't go to school at the same time I did, but not long after that mother told me he went to our camp and lay down on my bed and told her, ‚ÄúWell, I guess I'll go to school also.‚Äù He didn't have to go, but he wanted to be with me. The first I knew of it, I saw him there at the school, with his hair already cut like a schoolboy. All three of us were of the same band. We always went about together. Paul was my cross-cousin by clan because his clan was related to that of my father. He was also the son of my mother's half-sister's son. Because of this, our families always camped close together, and that is how I got to know him so well. Elton was of the same clan as Paul and so was also¬†[Page 496]¬†my cross-cousin. Whenever we traveled, Elton and his mother used to accompany us, as she was a great friend of my mother's.


Another boy whom I went about with a great deal was the younger brother of Henry Hudson. He was of my father's clan [also a cross-cousin]. There was a boy named Calvin I used to see a lot of. His father's clan and my father's clan were the same, so we were parallel cousins, but I didn't know he was my brother in this way until very much later.¬†nd√®Àôz√©`,¬†the boy who used to be the leader of the¬†g√°Àôn¬†dances, was also a parallel cousin of mine for the same reason. This I did not know until we had grown up. There were other boys we saw, but I saw most of the first four above. There must have been about twenty-five of us boys who played around together. We were of varying ages. We didn't always play together, but often split up to play in small groups because some would want to go one way, some another. Some days there wasn't anything doing at all, and at other times fathers wouldn't let their boys go off to play because they had work for them to do, such as going after the horses. But whenever we played at games such as scouts and renegades, or held a dance, all of us would be there.


24In connection with a child's knowledge of social practices, Neil Buck once remarked, ‚ÄúAs a small boy I heard older people use the expression which signifies that a widow has been reclaimed in marriage by some kinsman of her dead husband. I used to wonder what it meant, and it was several years before I found out.‚Äù


25¬†Notice that the store is at a distance from the camp, just as it should be. Charge accounts are now the most common way of doing business, although they were less common in former times.

The material represents the period from 1893 to 1903. This, of course, was twenty years after the establishment of the San Carlos Reservation, when reservation life had settled into a groove of its own:


We children used to go to the edge of the river where the willows grew. There we made play wickiups of the willows and pretended to live as older people do. Boys and girls used to get married. Although we didn't exchange gifts such as horses at these marriages, we exchanged food and drink. The boy's family would prepare tulibai. There would be twenty-five mounds of earth piled up in a line, each representing one can of tulibai. The man whose daughter was to be married was invited to bring his family over to drink them. As each can was finished, the mound of earth was obliterated. A little later, the girl's family would prepare a great feast and invite the boy's family over. They had round¬†[Page 487]¬†flat pieces of limestone for the dishes and on each would be a different kind of make-believe food. When we got there, they would point out each kind to us, saying, ‚ÄúThis is walnuts; this is acorn meal and stewed meat.‚Äù


When a boy married, he never married his own sister. We knew about that. But we never thought about clan exogamy, and it didn't matter to us whether two children married who were of the same clan. We didn't pretend that they were of different clans. Also, we boys didn't avoid our own blood sisters, nor they us. We were too young for that. We didn't even pretend to avoid them. We began to think about that much later. We didn't joke our real cross-cousins then, either. We were too young.¬†24¬†


24In connection with a child's knowledge of social practices, Neil Buck once remarked, ‚ÄúAs a small boy I heard older people use the expression which signifies that a widow has been reclaimed in marriage by some kinsman of her dead husband. I used to wonder what it meant, and it was several years before I found out.‚Äù


A boy had to respect his parents-in-law and avoid his mother-in-law, so his camp was built at a little distance from that of his wife's parents. Though we called each other by our regular names in play when we wanted to, a man couldn't call the names of his parents-in-law, just as it is with grownups. He called them¬†c√†Àôd√†Àôn√≠`¬†[proper affinal term]. We had brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law whom we called¬†c√¨Œ≥√≠Àô¬†[proper affinal term] as well. We used to pretend that a man had obligations to his father-in-law. We had a play store, and he would have to go to the store all the time to buy things for his father-in-law. When we played family, we pretended we had children, but we never pretended that a woman was pregnant or that she gave birth to a baby. We didn't play that the youngest child was the favorite either, as it is among grownups.


I can remember one time when I was a small kid and we were playing family. One girl of the¬†n√°Œ≥√≤d√®sg√¨jn¬†clan was my mother. There were a lot of other small boys there. We made three or four little piles of dirt, calling them cans of tulibai. When we finished one can, we leveled the pile. Soon we all said we were drunk. I was my mother's only child, so I was alone. The other boys pretended to start a fight with me. They all jumped on me. The girl who was my mother hollered at the top of her lungs as a grown person would do, ‚ÄúThe¬†'√¨y√†`'√°iy‚ñ°¬†[clan] boys are fighting my son.‚Äù She shouted so loud that my real mother and older sister back at camp heard her. They used to laugh afterward when they told about it. But we didn't play at having clan blood-feuds. Maybe some children did, but then, you know, not all children play in the same way.


When we played at family and camp life, we did not pretend that one of us was chief and that others were wealthy, influential men, but we¬†[Page 488]¬†used to have police. When a man had tulibai, these police sometimes came around and caught him. Then the policeman would dump out the tulibai and arrest the man. The tulibai was muddy water. We had a place we pretended was the guardhouse, and the man would be put in there for three or four days. At this guardhouse food was given to the prisoners. We played at issuing rations also, just as they really did at the agency. The rations were issued to us by our police at the guardhouse. We used to ride to the guardhouse on willow sticks, which we said were horses, to receive our rations. The children would all line up in front of the guardhouse to get their rations. One policeman was detailed to watch the line and prevent any trouble which might arise, just as they really did at the agency, and a second issued the rations to us. We did not play school.


We didn't play at having cattle or burros or dogs, but we did play at horses. One boy would be sent out to drive the horses into camp. He would come in, bringing an armful of willow branches. These were the horses. Ration time would be coming round, so we would need the horses to ride in on to get rations. Men and their wives started off riding. If we had to stop on the way for the night, we tied our horses to a tree. Then we would pull up a few handfuls of grass and leave them there for the horse to eat, just as we had seen our elders do.


We boys also used to make wagons out of tin cans. That was before the railroad came through, and we used to see many teams go by on the way to San Carlos and Globe, hauling freight. They would camp along the road and leave tin cans. We made the wagons of these tin cans. We put the can in a fire and heated it until the solder at both ends melted, and the two round ends came loose. These we made into wheels, punching a hole through the centers for the axle. The rest of the tin we flattened out straight. Then we bent each edge down on the long sides. We punched other holes in the bent-down edges, so we could run sticks through for the axles and attach the wheels. We put two wheels in front and only one in back. Through the sides of the wagon bottom we struck upright poles to hold the loads on, just like a real wagon. Almost every boy had one of these. We used to pretend to haul loads of wood on them, lengths of greasewood about seven inches long. We hauled them to the store to sell to the storekeeper. Sometimes we boys played with the wagons by ourselves without girls, pretending that we were freighting. One boy would go ahead, the others following in a long line along the road, just as we had seen freighters go by. We were hauling to the store. When we played at home where the dogs were, we used to make believe they were horses, and pack loads on them. But the dogs would not follow us away from camp, so we had to use willow branches for horses elsewhere.


After we had been playing family and camps down by the river a¬†[Page 489]¬†while, one of the older boys would say he was going to be a white man and run a store. He would make a little inclosure by setting sticks up in the ground. This was the store. Inside, he used sticks to make a sort of shelf to put his goods on. He made things out of mud. These, and stones, were the store goods. The store was always about two hundred yards distant from our camps. When we went to the store to buy things, we used small stones for money. We didn't have any charge accounts.¬†25


25¬†Notice that the store is at a distance from the camp, just as it should be. Charge accounts are now the most common way of doing business, although they were less common in former times.


We never played at hunting large game such as deer, but all boys had bows and arrows and used to go out hunting small game. We really did it; we didn't play at it. We did not play at having farms and raising crops,





at going out to gather wild seeds and acorns, or at cooking mescal. That was the old way, but we had our store to buy food in. Girls used to cook mud in cans on a fire. That was our food. When we made a fire, we made a very small one because our play wickiups were small. A few boys had those small, old-fashioned matches, but the rest of us had to get our fire at home and carry it down to where we played.


Older boys made knives out of tin cans. Only boys, not girls, did this. The knife was made by bending a piece of tin about the end of a stick, so that it stayed in place. One end of the stick served as a handle. The blade was curved and ground to an edge. The older boys who had these knives always carried them in their pockets, so that if they were out hunting and broke an arrow they could fashion another. They always had a pocketful of all kinds of birds' feathers, as well as sinew, so that they could repair or make new arrows at any time.


Boys, not girls, used to pretend to smoke. We would go along the riverbanks where the water had exposed the dry, pithy root of a cottonwood. We smoked sections of this just like a cigar, and in our store the storekeeper had them for sale. We used to take only a few puffs on them and throw them away. We also dried the leaves of¬†tc'√≠≈Çt'√≤j√©`¬†[‚Äúone sucks it‚Äù (sour dock)] and kept them in a little sack. We rolled cigarettes with these, using the paper from sugar or coffee packages which we picked up at home. Our families did not scold us for doing this. We didn't make ropes to play with. The girls used to make dolls. Little girls made dolls by bundling old rags together and tying them around the middle. Sometimes they made the hair of shredded cloth. We didn't paint our faces, but we used to tattoo marks on our skin‚Äîjust marks, not letters. We put them on our wrists, hands, and faces.


[Page 490]


Sometimes we played at having a social dance. We made a little drum out of a tin can. We put some water inside and stretched a piece of cloth across the mouth, tying it there. There would be a whole crowd of children, just like big people gathered at a dance. The boys would sing and sometimes the little girls would sing also. We sang old CJ37's songs, his lightning songs.¬†26¬†


26¬†CJ37 was a very powerful lightning shaman in the community.


Some of the little boys would tell the little girls to go out and start dancing. They would, several of them dancing back and forth together to the music. Then the boys would tell them to dance¬†≈Ç√†d√†tc'√¨tc'√πc¬†[a type of social dance], and the little girls would pick partners from among the boys to dance with them. Most of these children were from six to eight years old. Older children didn't take part in it. We danced in the daytime, right beside our own homes.


We never played at having a puberty ceremony for a girl, at holding curing ceremonies for sick people, at giving a hunting ceremony, or at singing deer, snake, or other such sacred songs. But we did play at giving the¬†g√°Àôn¬†dance and social dances. One boy called¬†nd√®Àôz√©`¬†[‚Äútall one‚Äù] was the leader in our community in any play of this sort. I guess he did not wish to play at curing rites or hunting ceremonies, or we might have done it. As he took the initiative in such things, we merely followed him. He was about sixteen at the time all this happened, and I must have been around ten. Some of the other boys were big boys, fourteen and fifteen years old.¬†nd√®Àôz√©`¬†is still living at Fort Apache. He used to pretend he was the father of John Roberson [a famous¬†g√°Àôn¬†shaman at that time] and knew all the¬†g√°Àôn¬†power. He made small¬†g√°Àôn¬†masks for us to wear from the left-over pieces when the men made real¬†g√°Àôn¬†masks for a ceremony. They were of the sotol stalk. We gave these¬†g√°Àôn¬†dances at night. We didn't even pretend to be curing anyone, but just gave them to have the dance.¬†nd√®Àôz√©`¬†himself painted the boys who were going to dance as¬†g√°Àôn.¬†When John Roberson's father used to paint his own dancers, at the end he put a dot of white paint on each of his cheeks and then ran the ends of his fingers dipped in white paint down the backs of his hands in a zigzag. So this boy used to do the same thing. Then he walked out to where we had the fire and called out¬†h√†g√∫Àô, h√†g√∫Àô,¬†just as John Roberson's father did. This was a signal for the impersonators to make their entry.


We used to hold this dance not far from our own homes.¬†nd√®Àôz√©`¬†sang for us. He sang real¬†g√°Àôn¬†songs, ones belonging to this same¬†g√°Àôn¬†shaman which he had picked up from hearing him sing them. He used to have a regular-sized drum made from a large can. He always brought it out when we had a dance. I don't know where he kept it. After the¬†g√°Àôn¬†dance was finished, we would have the circle dance.¬†27¬†


27¬†This customarily follows the completion of the¬†g√°Àôn¬†dance.


After the¬†[Page 491]¬†circle dance, we danced¬†≈Ç√®d√†tc'√¨tc'√πc.¬†Sometimes it used to turn into a real big dance, older youths and maidens coming down and joining in, helping to carry it through. We younger boys and girls would social dance also. Little girls walked up to a boy and touched him on the shoulder, inviting him to dance, just like grownups. But when only we younger children were playing at it, the dance petered out after a while. We would get tired of it. For the social dancing,¬†nd√®Àôz√©`¬†and some of the rest of us boys sang lightning songs, ones that belonged to the old man, CJ37. He knew we used them, but he didn't seem to mind. When the dance was finished, we put the¬†g√°Àôn¬†masks away in the brush for the night. The next morning we would conceal them where no one could find them, just as a real¬†g√°Àôn¬†shaman would do with his masks. Grownups didn't come to watch these dances of ours. They didn't seem to bother particularly about them, though sometimes our parents would tell us not to do it any more. But you know how kids are. They don't always obey their parents. We kept it up.


John Roberson's father used to give his¬†g√°Àôn¬†dance at almost every girl's puberty ceremony. After the ceremony he put the masks away in a cave across the river, not so far from where we lived. Other shamans who had ceremonial articles to be put away used the same cave. There was a great deal of ceremonial material in this cave.¬†28¬†


28¬†Such ceremonial objects, once put away, are never used again. It would be very dangerous to disturb them.


Sometimes when just we boys were off in the hills during the daytime, without any girls, we would go to this cave, take the masks out, put them on, and pretend to dance. This was under the leadership of¬†nd√®Àôz√©`.¬†But we never touched the hoops or crosses of the lightning shamans which were there. We were afraid of them.¬†29¬†


29¬†Lightning is the most dreaded of all supernatural forces.


We fooled around with the masks for an hour or so and then put them back and went on our way.¬†30¬†


30¬†The same thing was recorded for aboriginal times.


One time, I and some other boys went past this cave.¬†nd√®Àôz√©`,¬†who was with us, said, ‚ÄúCome on, let's have a dance.‚Äù We got the masks out, and he put them on us and painted us all up. We made dancing kilts by wrapping our shirts about our waists. Then he told us to wait there, that he was going off a little way, and, when he gave the call and started to sing, to come out and dance. We stood there, waiting. We waited and waited, but he did not call. Finally he took off the masks and went to see what was the matter. He was not there. He had played a joke and run off and left us. Not long after this, John Roberson's father must have found out what we boys had been doing. He must have dreamed about it, for he said, ‚ÄúSome boy is doing the same way I do.‚Äù He meant that someone had been using his masks.¬†[Page 492]¬†He was angry. But he didn't mind us children making our own small masks and putting on dances at home in which we used his songs. Later on, when¬†nd√®Àôz√©`¬†grew up, this same¬†g√°Àôn¬†shaman used him as a real¬†g√°Àôn¬†dancer. He was a very good one and danced many times, but he never became a¬†g√°Àôn¬†shaman.


There are no children's songs. The only songs that children sing are ones they hear grownups sing. I first started to sing when I was about six or seven. I sang a few songs such as the lightning songs of CJ37, but I only knew parts, not the whole song. I also was able to sing snatches of love songs that I had heard, but I couldn't sing any social dance songs. They were too hard. All of us kids would try to sing parts of such songs as these, but it wasn't until I was about ten that I first really started to learn whole songs. Old CJ37 often sang all night at curing or other ceremonies. He sang lightning songs and medicine songs, as well as others. We boys weren't meant to attend these ceremonies, but we did. The first song I learned to sing was a lightning song. We used to go to the curing ceremonies of CJ13, another shaman. He had all kinds of power for curing sicknesses: snake power, bear power, and others. From hearing these songs sung, we boys learned them. We could not sing the words, but we could sing the choruses. We used to try out one song at our play dances and sing it over and over again until we finally learned it. Then we would learn another and start using it.


We did not play at death and burial. We never did. I don't think it was because we were afraid of it. It was mainly because we never thought about playing that way. Besides, we didn't have the amount of sickness and death then that we have had since.


By the time I was old enough to join in the boys' war game [after eleven or twelve], boys had ceased playing it. But when I was a small boy, not yet old enough to join in, I can remember older boys playing it. Down at Dewey Flats, the Eastern White Mountain camps were on one side of the river, the Western White Mountain camps on the other. The boys from each side played this game against one another. They fought with slings and stones. The Yavapai, camped on the river below us, fought the Arivaipa boys near them in the same way. Big boys and sometimes men took part. Once I was swimming in the river with another small boy. We had no clothes on. A Yavapai youth came along and slung a stone at us. We got up and ran. We tried to throw rocks at him, but missed. We escaped into some thick brush and lay there. He could not see us but slung a stone blindly into the thicket. It hit me right on the buttocks. Years later I met this Yavapai as a man. We talked about that time and laughed.


When I was a boy of ten or so, I used to pretend to play at ‚Äúhidden-ball‚Äù with other boys my age. We didn't play with moccasins but hid¬†[Page 493]¬†the ball in the ground. We learned this game from the San Carlos people. We used to go and watch grown men playing it, for they played it not far from the camps. That's how we learned it. After watching a game among the men, boys were likely to start one of their own the next day. We played either during the day or at night, sometimes inside the wickiup. But we just played a little while and then quit. We would bet arrows and marbles with each other. Little girls came and watched us, just like women do at a real game, but they never played. When I was older, I and other boys my age played at hoop-and-poles. But until boys were about fifteen years old they never played this game. It was a man's game. I can remember when I and two friends of mine played it. We had a set of poles made of batamota, and our hoop was of mesquite root. Sometimes, boys made their hoop-and-poles of willow. A boy who owned a set always took it home with him at night after the game, just as a man would do. We had lots of fun playing at this game. There would be a whole lot of boys, just as there were many men about a hoop-and-poles course when they played. We knew exactly how to play it, and our hoops had ‚Äúbig bead‚Äù in the middle, with fifty beads, sometimes sixty-one beads, on each side.¬†31¬†


31¬†Beads are the coils about a cord tied across the diameter of the hoop. They are used in scoring.


We gambled, betting our marbles and tops, but we never pretended to have gambling power for this game. We didn't know about that. Boys weren't allowed to use a real set of hoop-and-poles for fear they would damage them. Just as no women or girls were allowed around when men played hoop-and-poles, we boys didn't let any girls come where we were playing.


Up to ten years old or so boys and girls very often played together, but after eleven or twelve they separated. The sort of play I have told you about [all the preceding, excluding the hoop-and-poles game, the play with the real¬†g√°Àôn¬†masks, and the boy's war game] was mainly girls and boys together. Boys alone didn't play at family, marriage, cooking, making wickiups, or rations. After a boy was eleven or twelve, he spent most of his time going about in groups with other boys, hunting birds and small animals, sometimes all day and even at night, or playing certain boy's games which I will tell you about. Girls played separately from big boys after this age also. Many girls played until they were fifteen or so. They made wickiups just as we did when younger, but these were larger and better made, about six feet high. Inside they played at household with little children, both boys and girls, though these little kids were just there mainly to watch them. That's the way small children learn to play. The big girls would play at cooking. They didn't pretend mud was their food, the way small children do, but they boiled water, pretending it was tulibai and such things. They used to¬†[Page [facing p.494]]





[Page 494]¬†make dolls, really good ones, and clothe them in girl's dresses which they sewed. They made the hair of real hair so that it hung down the back. They made miniature moccasins of buckskin for them. They knew how to make good dolls.


We big boys used to hunt kangaroo rats out in the brush at night-time. We didn't eat them. We just killed them. One time a bunch of us boys went across the river from Dewey Flats and killed a whole sackful. There was an old woman living near by who was so old that she was in her second childhood. She spent most of her time asleep. That night we crept into her wickiup and put the sack of rats at the side of her bed as she slept. She slept with the kangaroo rats all night, not knowing it. Next morning I guess she was mad when she found out. Sometimes we boys hunted quail at night. We crossed back and forth across the Gila River as many as two and three times in a night doing this, even in wintertime. I and one of my cross-cousins were out like this one night. We thought we saw a duck in the river. We shot at it. It was just an old stick. We lost our arrow and so we built a fire and made another one by its light. At other times we went up toward Turn-bull Mountain, where there were many cactus plants growing. The quail roosted on these, and we killed them. Sometimes three or four of us would ride burros out into the hills to shoot doves during their nesting season. They were easy to hit when they sat on the nest. When we went out in the hills to hunt, the oldest boy was always the leader. We went where he said. When we killed birds, sometimes we would stop and cook and eat them.


We used to play at renegades and soldiers. CJ30 played with us. He was a lot older than the rest of us. He always used to take the part of Apache Kid, and one other boy always took the part of a Chiricahua renegade. The rest of us were soldiers and scouts and would try to capture these two. There were two hills where we usually played this game. The renegades would come out on the side of one hill and holler at us. Then they would come out on the other side of the hill and shout. We used horse manure as bullets. If you got hit by one of these bullets, you were dead right there. For our captain we had one lame boy. There were boys older than he who could have been captain, but we made him captain because he could not travel fast and was always in the rear.¬†32¬†


32¬†Old scouts often speak of how their white officers were unable to keep up with them on foot during campaigns against hostile Apache.


We always played this game at night. One evening when we were playing we saw a man coming riding toward us. We could see the glint of his rifle barrel in the moonlight. It was only the older brother of Elton Causey coming home from a party, but, thinking it was really Apache Kid, we got scared and all ran off. Our captain was left behind. He hollered at us. Later, the same evening, the oldest¬†[Page [facing p. 495]]





[Page 495]¬†boys among us went up to where some white men, freighting with wagons, had camped for the night. They crept into the camp and stole some biscuits out of a dutch oven. They took a can of salt too. They brought this back to where the rest of us were waiting. We split the biscuits up between us, put salt on them, and ate them. Each one of us got one. This was to feed us soldiers. The white men must have been very sound asleep. The next morning a white man from the camp climbed up on top of a hill where he could overlook our camps. He thought we had taken the biscuits, but he didn't say anything.


One time I, Charley Sago,¬†nd√®Àôz√©`,¬†and some other boys went down river to where the Yavapai were living. We hung about all day. We saw that the Yavapai had a lot of good melons in their fields. We waited until night and then went into the fields and ate our fill of them. We gathered more melons and took them up to where some Mexican freighters were camped on the road. They gave us a meal and some sugar and coffee in exchange for the melons. We left, and after we had gone a little way we could hear the Mexicans commence to shout. We thought that the Yavapai must have found the Mexicans with their melons and that they would soon be on our trail. We ran for it. After a while we heard someone coming on horseback, so we split up. It was too dark to see. When the rider was close, one of the boys hollered, ‚ÄúHello.‚Äù The man answered ‚ÄúHello‚Äù and went on. After going a way farther, we stopped and built a fire to warm ourselves. From there we went to our homes. When I got home, I found mother telling stories with an old woman. That's the way old women used to do. They had cooked up some corn and were eating it. I had some of the coffee and sugar tied in the corner of my shirt. Mother asked me where I got it, and I told her that the Mexicans had given it to me. But I really got it for the melons I had stolen.


I can't remember the children that I played with before I was ten, but from then on, until I went off to school at fourteen, my two best friends were Paul Nosey and Elton Causey. The first died in school.¬†33¬†


33¬†The second boy mentioned was not a close friend of the narrator's in adult life.


The second didn't go to school at the same time I did, but not long after that mother told me he went to our camp and lay down on my bed and told her, ‚ÄúWell, I guess I'll go to school also.‚Äù He didn't have to go, but he wanted to be with me. The first I knew of it, I saw him there at the school, with his hair already cut like a schoolboy. All three of us were of the same band. We always went about together. Paul was my cross-cousin by clan because his clan was related to that of my father. He was also the son of my mother's half-sister's son. Because of this, our families always camped close together, and that is how I got to know him so well. Elton was of the same clan as Paul and so was also¬†[Page 496]¬†my cross-cousin. Whenever we traveled, Elton and his mother used to accompany us, as she was a great friend of my mother's.


Another boy whom I went about with a great deal was the younger brother of Henry Hudson. He was of my father's clan [also a cross-cousin]. There was a boy named Calvin I used to see a lot of. His father's clan and my father's clan were the same, so we were parallel cousins, but I didn't know he was my brother in this way until very much later.¬†nd√®Àôz√©`,¬†the boy who used to be the leader of the¬†g√°Àôn¬†dances, was also a parallel cousin of mine for the same reason. This I did not know until we had grown up. There were other boys we saw, but I saw most of the first four above. There must have been about twenty-five of us boys who played around together. We were of varying ages. We didn't always play together, but often split up to play in small groups because some would want to go one way, some another. Some days there wasn't anything doing at all, and at other times fathers wouldn't let their boys go off to play because they had work for them to do, such as going after the horses. But whenever we played at games such as scouts and renegades, or held a dance, all of us would be there.",NA,NA,https://ehrafworldcultures.yale.edu/sres/852d509b-4a16-4a8a-a3be-f480df52ad3f,33.86,-110.12,1942,5580,Use,Single

The material represents the period from 1893 to 1903. This, of course, was twenty years after the establishment of the San Carlos Reservation, when reservation life had settled into a groove of its own:


We children used to go to the edge of the river where the willows grew. There we made play wickiups of the willows and pretended to live as older people do. Boys and girls used to get married. Although we didn't exchange gifts such as horses at these marriages, we exchanged food and drink. The boy's family would prepare tulibai. There would be twenty-five mounds of earth piled up in a line, each representing one can of tulibai. The man whose daughter was to be married was invited to bring his family over to drink them. As each can was finished, the mound of earth was obliterated. A little later, the girl's family would prepare a great feast and invite the boy's family over. They had round¬†[Page 487]¬†flat pieces of limestone for the dishes and on each would be a different kind of make-believe food. When we got there, they would point out each kind to us, saying, ‚ÄúThis is walnuts; this is acorn meal and stewed meat.‚Äù


When a boy married, he never married his own sister. We knew about that. But we never thought about clan exogamy, and it didn't matter to us whether two children married who were of the same clan. We didn't pretend that they were of different clans. Also, we boys didn't avoid our own blood sisters, nor they us. We were too young for that. We didn't even pretend to avoid them. We began to think about that much later. We didn't joke our real cross-cousins then, either. We were too young.¬†24¬†





A boy had to respect his parents-in-law and avoid his mother-in-law, so his camp was built at a little distance from that of his wife's parents. Though we called each other by our regular names in play when we wanted to, a man couldn't call the names of his parents-in-law, just as it is with grownups. He called them¬†c√†Àôd√†Àôn√≠`¬†[proper affinal term]. We had brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law whom we called¬†c√¨Œ≥√≠Àô¬†[proper affinal term] as well. We used to pretend that a man had obligations to his father-in-law. We had a play store, and he would have to go to the store all the time to buy things for his father-in-law. When we played family, we pretended we had children, but we never pretended that a woman was pregnant or that she gave birth to a baby. We didn't play that the youngest child was the favorite either, as it is among grownups.


I can remember one time when I was a small kid and we were playing family. One girl of the¬†n√°Œ≥√≤d√®sg√¨jn¬†clan was my mother. There were a lot of other small boys there. We made three or four little piles of dirt, calling them cans of tulibai. When we finished one can, we leveled the pile. Soon we all said we were drunk. I was my mother's only child, so I was alone. The other boys pretended to start a fight with me. They all jumped on me. The girl who was my mother hollered at the top of her lungs as a grown person would do, ‚ÄúThe¬†'√¨y√†`'√°iy‚ñ°¬†[clan] boys are fighting my son.‚Äù She shouted so loud that my real mother and older sister back at camp heard her. They used to laugh afterward when they told about it. But we didn't play at having clan blood-feuds. Maybe some children did, but then, you know, not all children play in the same way.





When we played at family and camp life, we did not pretend that one of us was chief and that others were wealthy, influential men, but we¬†[Page 488]¬†used to have police. When a man had tulibai, these police sometimes came around and caught him. Then the policeman would dump out the tulibai and arrest the man. The tulibai was muddy water. We had a place we pretended was the guardhouse, and the man would be put in there for three or four days. At this guardhouse food was given to the prisoners. We played at issuing rations also, just as they really did at the agency. The rations were issued to us by our police at the guardhouse. We used to ride to the guardhouse on willow sticks, which we said were horses, to receive our rations. The children would all line up in front of the guardhouse to get their rations. One policeman was detailed to watch the line and prevent any trouble which might arise, just as they really did at the agency, and a second issued the rations to us. We did not play school.


We didn't play at having cattle or burros or dogs, but we did play at horses. One boy would be sent out to drive the horses into camp. He would come in, bringing an armful of willow branches. These were the horses. Ration time would be coming round, so we would need the horses to ride in on to get rations. Men and their wives started off riding. If we had to stop on the way for the night, we tied our horses to a tree. Then we would pull up a few handfuls of grass and leave them there for the horse to eat, just as we had seen our elders do.


We boys also used to make wagons out of tin cans. That was before the railroad came through, and we used to see many teams go by on the way to San Carlos and Globe, hauling freight. They would camp along the road and leave tin cans. We made the wagons of these tin cans. We put the can in a fire and heated it until the solder at both ends melted, and the two round ends came loose. These we made into wheels, punching a hole through the centers for the axle. The rest of the tin we flattened out straight. Then we bent each edge down on the long sides. We punched other holes in the bent-down edges, so we could run sticks through for the axles and attach the wheels. We put two wheels in front and only one in back. Through the sides of the wagon bottom we struck upright poles to hold the loads on, just like a real wagon. Almost every boy had one of these. We used to pretend to haul loads of wood on them, lengths of greasewood about seven inches long. We hauled them to the store to sell to the storekeeper. Sometimes we boys played with the wagons by ourselves without girls, pretending that we were freighting. One boy would go ahead, the others following in a long line along the road, just as we had seen freighters go by. We were hauling to the store. When we played at home where the dogs were, we used to make believe they were horses, and pack loads on them. But the dogs would not follow us away from camp, so we had to use willow branches for horses elsewhere.


After we had been playing family and camps down by the river a¬†[Page 489]¬†while, one of the older boys would say he was going to be a white man and run a store. He would make a little inclosure by setting sticks up in the ground. This was the store. Inside, he used sticks to make a sort of shelf to put his goods on. He made things out of mud. These, and stones, were the store goods. The store was always about two hundred yards distant from our camps. When we went to the store to buy things, we used small stones for money. We didn't have any charge accounts.¬†25


We never played at hunting large game such as deer, but all boys had bows and arrows and used to go out hunting small game. We really did it; we didn't play at it. We did not play at having farms and raising crops,


BOY'S KNIFE


at going out to gather wild seeds and acorns, or at cooking mescal. That was the old way, but we had our store to buy food in. Girls used to cook mud in cans on a fire. That was our food. When we made a fire, we made a very small one because our play wickiups were small. A few boys had those small, old-fashioned matches, but the rest of us had to get our fire at home and carry it down to where we played.


Older boys made knives out of tin cans. Only boys, not girls, did this. The knife was made by bending a piece of tin about the end of a stick, so that it stayed in place. One end of the stick served as a handle. The blade was curved and ground to an edge. The older boys who had these knives always carried them in their pockets, so that if they were out hunting and broke an arrow they could fashion another. They always had a pocketful of all kinds of birds' feathers, as well as sinew, so that they could repair or make new arrows at any time.


Boys, not girls, used to pretend to smoke. We would go along the riverbanks where the water had exposed the dry, pithy root of a cottonwood. We smoked sections of this just like a cigar, and in our store the storekeeper had them for sale. We used to take only a few puffs on them and throw them away. We also dried the leaves of¬†tc'√≠≈Çt'√≤j√©`¬†[‚Äúone sucks it‚Äù (sour dock)] and kept them in a little sack. We rolled cigarettes with these, using the paper from sugar or coffee packages which we picked up at home. Our families did not scold us for doing this. We didn't make ropes to play with. The girls used to make dolls. Little girls made dolls by bundling old rags together and tying them around the middle. Sometimes they made the hair of shredded cloth. We didn't paint our faces, but we used to tattoo marks on our skin‚Äîjust marks, not letters. We put them on our wrists, hands, and faces.


[Page 490]


Sometimes we played at having a social dance. We made a little drum out of a tin can. We put some water inside and stretched a piece of cloth across the mouth, tying it there. There would be a whole crowd of children, just like big people gathered at a dance. The boys would sing and sometimes the little girls would sing also. We sang old CJ37's songs, his lightning songs.¬†26¬†


Some of the little boys would tell the little girls to go out and start dancing. They would, several of them dancing back and forth together to the music. Then the boys would tell them to dance¬†≈Ç√†d√†tc'√¨tc'√πc¬†[a type of social dance], and the little girls would pick partners from among the boys to dance with them. Most of these children were from six to eight years old. Older children didn't take part in it. We danced in the daytime, right beside our own homes.


We never played at having a puberty ceremony for a girl, at holding curing ceremonies for sick people, at giving a hunting ceremony, or at singing deer, snake, or other such sacred songs. But we did play at giving the¬†g√°Àôn¬†dance and social dances. One boy called¬†nd√®Àôz√©`¬†[‚Äútall one‚Äù] was the leader in our community in any play of this sort. I guess he did not wish to play at curing rites or hunting ceremonies, or we might have done it. As he took the initiative in such things, we merely followed him. He was about sixteen at the time all this happened, and I must have been around ten. Some of the other boys were big boys, fourteen and fifteen years old.¬†nd√®Àôz√©`¬†is still living at Fort Apache. He used to pretend he was the father of John Roberson [a famous¬†g√°Àôn¬†shaman at that time] and knew all the¬†g√°Àôn¬†power. He made small¬†g√°Àôn¬†masks for us to wear from the left-over pieces when the men made real¬†g√°Àôn¬†masks for a ceremony. They were of the sotol stalk. We gave these¬†g√°Àôn¬†dances at night. We didn't even pretend to be curing anyone, but just gave them to have the dance.¬†nd√®Àôz√©`¬†himself painted the boys who were going to dance as¬†g√°Àôn.¬†When John Roberson's father used to paint his own dancers, at the end he put a dot of white paint on each of his cheeks and then ran the ends of his fingers dipped in white paint down the backs of his hands in a zigzag. So this boy used to do the same thing. Then he walked out to where we had the fire and called out¬†h√†g√∫Àô, h√†g√∫Àô,¬†just as John Roberson's father did. This was a signal for the impersonators to make their entry.


We used to hold this dance not far from our own homes.¬†nd√®Àôz√©`¬†sang for us. He sang real¬†g√°Àôn¬†songs, ones belonging to this same¬†g√°Àôn¬†shaman which he had picked up from hearing him sing them. He used to have a regular-sized drum made from a large can. He always brought it out when we had a dance. I don't know where he kept it. After the¬†g√°Àôn¬†dance was finished, we would have the circle dance.¬†27¬†


After the¬†[Page 491]¬†circle dance, we danced¬†≈Ç√®d√†tc'√¨tc'√πc.¬†Sometimes it used to turn into a real big dance, older youths and maidens coming down and joining in, helping to carry it through. We younger boys and girls would social dance also. Little girls walked up to a boy and touched him on the shoulder, inviting him to dance, just like grownups. But when only we younger children were playing at it, the dance petered out after a while. We would get tired of it. For the social dancing,¬†nd√®Àôz√©`¬†and some of the rest of us boys sang lightning songs, ones that belonged to the old man, CJ37. He knew we used them, but he didn't seem to mind. When the dance was finished, we put the¬†g√°Àôn¬†masks away in the brush for the night. The next morning we would conceal them where no one could find them, just as a real¬†g√°Àôn¬†shaman would do with his masks. Grownups didn't come to watch these dances of ours. They didn't seem to bother particularly about them, though sometimes our parents would tell us not to do it any more. But you know how kids are. They don't always obey their parents. We kept it up.


John Roberson's father used to give his¬†g√°Àôn¬†dance at almost every girl's puberty ceremony. After the ceremony he put the masks away in a cave across the river, not so far from where we lived. Other shamans who had ceremonial articles to be put away used the same cave. There was a great deal of ceremonial material in this cave.¬†28¬†


Sometimes when just we boys were off in the hills during the daytime, without any girls, we would go to this cave, take the masks out, put them on, and pretend to dance. This was under the leadership of¬†nd√®Àôz√©`.¬†But we never touched the hoops or crosses of the lightning shamans which were there. We were afraid of them.¬†29¬†


We fooled around with the masks for an hour or so and then put them back and went on our way.¬†30¬†





One time, I and some other boys went past this cave.¬†nd√®Àôz√©`,¬†who was with us, said, ‚ÄúCome on, let's have a dance.‚Äù We got the masks out, and he put them on us and painted us all up. We made dancing kilts by wrapping our shirts about our waists. Then he told us to wait there, that he was going off a little way, and, when he gave the call and started to sing, to come out and dance. We stood there, waiting. We waited and waited, but he did not call. Finally he took off the masks and went to see what was the matter. He was not there. He had played a joke and run off and left us. Not long after this, John Roberson's father must have found out what we boys had been doing. He must have dreamed about it, for he said, ‚ÄúSome boy is doing the same way I do.‚Äù He meant that someone had been using his masks.¬†[Page 492]¬†He was angry. But he didn't mind us children making our own small masks and putting on dances at home in which we used his songs. Later on, when¬†nd√®Àôz√©`¬†grew up, this same¬†g√°Àôn¬†shaman used him as a real¬†g√°Àôn¬†dancer. He was a very good one and danced many times, but he never became a¬†g√°Àôn¬†shaman.


There are no children's songs. The only songs that children sing are ones they hear grownups sing. I first started to sing when I was about six or seven. I sang a few songs such as the lightning songs of CJ37, but I only knew parts, not the whole song. I also was able to sing snatches of love songs that I had heard, but I couldn't sing any social dance songs. They were too hard. All of us kids would try to sing parts of such songs as these, but it wasn't until I was about ten that I first really started to learn whole songs. Old CJ37 often sang all night at curing or other ceremonies. He sang lightning songs and medicine songs, as well as others. We boys weren't meant to attend these ceremonies, but we did. The first song I learned to sing was a lightning song. We used to go to the curing ceremonies of CJ13, another shaman. He had all kinds of power for curing sicknesses: snake power, bear power, and others. From hearing these songs sung, we boys learned them. We could not sing the words, but we could sing the choruses. We used to try out one song at our play dances and sing it over and over again until we finally learned it. Then we would learn another and start using it.


We did not play at death and burial. We never did. I don't think it was because we were afraid of it. It was mainly because we never thought about playing that way. Besides, we didn't have the amount of sickness and death then that we have had since.


By the time I was old enough to join in the boys' war game [after eleven or twelve], boys had ceased playing it. But when I was a small boy, not yet old enough to join in, I can remember older boys playing it. Down at Dewey Flats, the Eastern White Mountain camps were on one side of the river, the Western White Mountain camps on the other. The boys from each side played this game against one another. They fought with slings and stones. The Yavapai, camped on the river below us, fought the Arivaipa boys near them in the same way. Big boys and sometimes men took part. Once I was swimming in the river with another small boy. We had no clothes on. A Yavapai youth came along and slung a stone at us. We got up and ran. We tried to throw rocks at him, but missed. We escaped into some thick brush and lay there. He could not see us but slung a stone blindly into the thicket. It hit me right on the buttocks. Years later I met this Yavapai as a man. We talked about that time and laughed.


When I was a boy of ten or so, I used to pretend to play at ‚Äúhidden-ball‚Äù with other boys my age. We didn't play with moccasins but hid¬†[Page 493]¬†the ball in the ground. We learned this game from the San Carlos people. We used to go and watch grown men playing it, for they played it not far from the camps. That's how we learned it. After watching a game among the men, boys were likely to start one of their own the next day. We played either during the day or at night, sometimes inside the wickiup. But we just played a little while and then quit. We would bet arrows and marbles with each other. Little girls came and watched us, just like women do at a real game, but they never played. When I was older, I and other boys my age played at hoop-and-poles. But until boys were about fifteen years old they never played this game. It was a man's game. I can remember when I and two friends of mine played it. We had a set of poles made of batamota, and our hoop was of mesquite root. Sometimes, boys made their hoop-and-poles of willow. A boy who owned a set always took it home with him at night after the game, just as a man would do. We had lots of fun playing at this game. There would be a whole lot of boys, just as there were many men about a hoop-and-poles course when they played. We knew exactly how to play it, and our hoops had ‚Äúbig bead‚Äù in the middle, with fifty beads, sometimes sixty-one beads, on each side.¬†31¬†


We gambled, betting our marbles and tops, but we never pretended to have gambling power for this game. We didn't know about that. Boys weren't allowed to use a real set of hoop-and-poles for fear they would damage them. Just as no women or girls were allowed around when men played hoop-and-poles, we boys didn't let any girls come where we were playing.


Up to ten years old or so boys and girls very often played together, but after eleven or twelve they separated. The sort of play I have told you about [all the preceding, excluding the hoop-and-poles game, the play with the real¬†g√°Àôn¬†masks, and the boy's war game] was mainly girls and boys together. Boys alone didn't play at family, marriage, cooking, making wickiups, or rations. After a boy was eleven or twelve, he spent most of his time going about in groups with other boys, hunting birds and small animals, sometimes all day and even at night, or playing certain boy's games which I will tell you about. Girls played separately from big boys after this age also. Many girls played until they were fifteen or so. They made wickiups just as we did when younger, but these were larger and better made, about six feet high. Inside they played at household with little children, both boys and girls, though these little kids were just there mainly to watch them. That's the way small children learn to play. The big girls would play at cooking. They didn't pretend mud was their food, the way small children do, but they boiled water, pretending it was tulibai and such things. They used to¬†[Page [facing p.494]]


PLATE VIII


PLAYING AT COOKING


[Page 494]¬†make dolls, really good ones, and clothe them in girl's dresses which they sewed. They made the hair of real hair so that it hung down the back. They made miniature moccasins of buckskin for them. They knew how to make good dolls.


We big boys used to hunt kangaroo rats out in the brush at night-time. We didn't eat them. We just killed them. One time a bunch of us boys went across the river from Dewey Flats and killed a whole sackful. There was an old woman living near by who was so old that she was in her second childhood. She spent most of her time asleep. That night we crept into her wickiup and put the sack of rats at the side of her bed as she slept. She slept with the kangaroo rats all night, not knowing it. Next morning I guess she was mad when she found out. Sometimes we boys hunted quail at night. We crossed back and forth across the Gila River as many as two and three times in a night doing this, even in wintertime. I and one of my cross-cousins were out like this one night. We thought we saw a duck in the river. We shot at it. It was just an old stick. We lost our arrow and so we built a fire and made another one by its light. At other times we went up toward Turn-bull Mountain, where there were many cactus plants growing. The quail roosted on these, and we killed them. Sometimes three or four of us would ride burros out into the hills to shoot doves during their nesting season. They were easy to hit when they sat on the nest. When we went out in the hills to hunt, the oldest boy was always the leader. We went where he said. When we killed birds, sometimes we would stop and cook and eat them.


We used to play at renegades and soldiers. CJ30 played with us. He was a lot older than the rest of us. He always used to take the part of Apache Kid, and one other boy always took the part of a Chiricahua renegade. The rest of us were soldiers and scouts and would try to capture these two. There were two hills where we usually played this game. The renegades would come out on the side of one hill and holler at us. Then they would come out on the other side of the hill and shout. We used horse manure as bullets. If you got hit by one of these bullets, you were dead right there. For our captain we had one lame boy. There were boys older than he who could have been captain, but we made him captain because he could not travel fast and was always in the rear.¬†32¬†





We always played this game at night. One evening when we were playing we saw a man coming riding toward us. We could see the glint of his rifle barrel in the moonlight. It was only the older brother of Elton Causey coming home from a party, but, thinking it was really Apache Kid, we got scared and all ran off. Our captain was left behind. He hollered at us. Later, the same evening, the oldest¬†[Page [facing p. 495]]


PLATE IX


CHILDREN AT PLAY


[Page 495]¬†boys among us went up to where some white men, freighting with wagons, had camped for the night. They crept into the camp and stole some biscuits out of a dutch oven. They took a can of salt too. They brought this back to where the rest of us were waiting. We split the biscuits up between us, put salt on them, and ate them. Each one of us got one. This was to feed us soldiers. The white men must have been very sound asleep. The next morning a white man from the camp climbed up on top of a hill where he could overlook our camps. He thought we had taken the biscuits, but he didn't say anything.


One time I, Charley Sago,¬†nd√®Àôz√©`,¬†and some other boys went down river to where the Yavapai were living. We hung about all day. We saw that the Yavapai had a lot of good melons in their fields. We waited until night and then went into the fields and ate our fill of them. We gathered more melons and took them up to where some Mexican freighters were camped on the road. They gave us a meal and some sugar and coffee in exchange for the melons. We left, and after we had gone a little way we could hear the Mexicans commence to shout. We thought that the Yavapai must have found the Mexicans with their melons and that they would soon be on our trail. We ran for it. After a while we heard someone coming on horseback, so we split up. It was too dark to see. When the rider was close, one of the boys hollered, ‚ÄúHello.‚Äù The man answered ‚ÄúHello‚Äù and went on. After going a way farther, we stopped and built a fire to warm ourselves. From there we went to our homes. When I got home, I found mother telling stories with an old woman. That's the way old women used to do. They had cooked up some corn and were eating it. I had some of the coffee and sugar tied in the corner of my shirt. Mother asked me where I got it, and I told her that the Mexicans had given it to me. But I really got it for the melons I had stolen.


I can't remember the children that I played with before I was ten, but from then on, until I went off to school at fourteen, my two best friends were Paul Nosey and Elton Causey. The first died in school.¬†33¬†


The second didn't go to school at the same time I did, but not long after that mother told me he went to our camp and lay down on my bed and told her, ‚ÄúWell, I guess I'll go to school also.‚Äù He didn't have to go, but he wanted to be with me. The first I knew of it, I saw him there at the school, with his hair already cut like a schoolboy. All three of us were of the same band. We always went about together. Paul was my cross-cousin by clan because his clan was related to that of my father. He was also the son of my mother's half-sister's son. Because of this, our families always camped close together, and that is how I got to know him so well. Elton was of the same clan as Paul and so was also¬†[Page 496]¬†my cross-cousin. Whenever we traveled, Elton and his mother used to accompany us, as she was a great friend of my mother's.


Another boy whom I went about with a great deal was the younger brother of Henry Hudson. He was of my father's clan [also a cross-cousin]. There was a boy named Calvin I used to see a lot of. His father's clan and my father's clan were the same, so we were parallel cousins, but I didn't know he was my brother in this way until very much later.¬†nd√®Àôz√©`,¬†the boy who used to be the leader of the¬†g√°Àôn¬†dances, was also a parallel cousin of mine for the same reason. This I did not know until we had grown up. There were other boys we saw, but I saw most of the first four above. There must have been about twenty-five of us boys who played around together. We were of varying ages. We didn't always play together, but often split up to play in small groups because some would want to go one way, some another. Some days there wasn't anything doing at all, and at other times fathers wouldn't let their boys go off to play because they had work for them to do, such as going after the horses. But whenever we played at games such as scouts and renegades, or held a dance, all of us would be there.


24In connection with a child's knowledge of social practices, Neil Buck once remarked, ‚ÄúAs a small boy I heard older people use the expression which signifies that a widow has been reclaimed in marriage by some kinsman of her dead husband. I used to wonder what it meant, and it was several years before I found out.‚Äù


25¬†Notice that the store is at a distance from the camp, just as it should be. Charge accounts are now the most common way of doing business, although they were less common in former times.

The material represents the period from 1893 to 1903. This, of course, was twenty years after the establishment of the San Carlos Reservation, when reservation life had settled into a groove of its own:


We children used to go to the edge of the river where the willows grew. There we made play wickiups of the willows and pretended to live as older people do. Boys and girls used to get married. Although we didn't exchange gifts such as horses at these marriages, we exchanged food and drink. The boy's family would prepare tulibai. There would be twenty-five mounds of earth piled up in a line, each representing one can of tulibai. The man whose daughter was to be married was invited to bring his family over to drink them. As each can was finished, the mound of earth was obliterated. A little later, the girl's family would prepare a great feast and invite the boy's family over. They had round¬†[Page 487]¬†flat pieces of limestone for the dishes and on each would be a different kind of make-believe food. When we got there, they would point out each kind to us, saying, ‚ÄúThis is walnuts; this is acorn meal and stewed meat.‚Äù


When a boy married, he never married his own sister. We knew about that. But we never thought about clan exogamy, and it didn't matter to us whether two children married who were of the same clan. We didn't pretend that they were of different clans. Also, we boys didn't avoid our own blood sisters, nor they us. We were too young for that. We didn't even pretend to avoid them. We began to think about that much later. We didn't joke our real cross-cousins then, either. We were too young.¬†24¬†





A boy had to respect his parents-in-law and avoid his mother-in-law, so his camp was built at a little distance from that of his wife's parents. Though we called each other by our regular names in play when we wanted to, a man couldn't call the names of his parents-in-law, just as it is with grownups. He called them¬†c√†Àôd√†Àôn√≠`¬†[proper affinal term]. We had brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law whom we called¬†c√¨Œ≥√≠Àô¬†[proper affinal term] as well. We used to pretend that a man had obligations to his father-in-law. We had a play store, and he would have to go to the store all the time to buy things for his father-in-law. When we played family, we pretended we had children, but we never pretended that a woman was pregnant or that she gave birth to a baby. We didn't play that the youngest child was the favorite either, as it is among grownups.


I can remember one time when I was a small kid and we were playing family. One girl of the¬†n√°Œ≥√≤d√®sg√¨jn¬†clan was my mother. There were a lot of other small boys there. We made three or four little piles of dirt, calling them cans of tulibai. When we finished one can, we leveled the pile. Soon we all said we were drunk. I was my mother's only child, so I was alone. The other boys pretended to start a fight with me. They all jumped on me. The girl who was my mother hollered at the top of her lungs as a grown person would do, ‚ÄúThe¬†'√¨y√†`'√°iy‚ñ°¬†[clan] boys are fighting my son.‚Äù She shouted so loud that my real mother and older sister back at camp heard her. They used to laugh afterward when they told about it. But we didn't play at having clan blood-feuds. Maybe some children did, but then, you know, not all children play in the same way.





When we played at family and camp life, we did not pretend that one of us was chief and that others were wealthy, influential men, but we¬†[Page 488]¬†used to have police. When a man had tulibai, these police sometimes came around and caught him. Then the policeman would dump out the tulibai and arrest the man. The tulibai was muddy water. We had a place we pretended was the guardhouse, and the man would be put in there for three or four days. At this guardhouse food was given to the prisoners. We played at issuing rations also, just as they really did at the agency. The rations were issued to us by our police at the guardhouse. We used to ride to the guardhouse on willow sticks, which we said were horses, to receive our rations. The children would all line up in front of the guardhouse to get their rations. One policeman was detailed to watch the line and prevent any trouble which might arise, just as they really did at the agency, and a second issued the rations to us. We did not play school.


We didn't play at having cattle or burros or dogs, but we did play at horses. One boy would be sent out to drive the horses into camp. He would come in, bringing an armful of willow branches. These were the horses. Ration time would be coming round, so we would need the horses to ride in on to get rations. Men and their wives started off riding. If we had to stop on the way for the night, we tied our horses to a tree. Then we would pull up a few handfuls of grass and leave them there for the horse to eat, just as we had seen our elders do.


We boys also used to make wagons out of tin cans. That was before the railroad came through, and we used to see many teams go by on the way to San Carlos and Globe, hauling freight. They would camp along the road and leave tin cans. We made the wagons of these tin cans. We put the can in a fire and heated it until the solder at both ends melted, and the two round ends came loose. These we made into wheels, punching a hole through the centers for the axle. The rest of the tin we flattened out straight. Then we bent each edge down on the long sides. We punched other holes in the bent-down edges, so we could run sticks through for the axles and attach the wheels. We put two wheels in front and only one in back. Through the sides of the wagon bottom we struck upright poles to hold the loads on, just like a real wagon. Almost every boy had one of these. We used to pretend to haul loads of wood on them, lengths of greasewood about seven inches long. We hauled them to the store to sell to the storekeeper. Sometimes we boys played with the wagons by ourselves without girls, pretending that we were freighting. One boy would go ahead, the others following in a long line along the road, just as we had seen freighters go by. We were hauling to the store. When we played at home where the dogs were, we used to make believe they were horses, and pack loads on them. But the dogs would not follow us away from camp, so we had to use willow branches for horses elsewhere.


After we had been playing family and camps down by the river a¬†[Page 489]¬†while, one of the older boys would say he was going to be a white man and run a store. He would make a little inclosure by setting sticks up in the ground. This was the store. Inside, he used sticks to make a sort of shelf to put his goods on. He made things out of mud. These, and stones, were the store goods. The store was always about two hundred yards distant from our camps. When we went to the store to buy things, we used small stones for money. We didn't have any charge accounts.¬†25


We never played at hunting large game such as deer, but all boys had bows and arrows and used to go out hunting small game. We really did it; we didn't play at it. We did not play at having farms and raising crops,


BOY'S KNIFE


at going out to gather wild seeds and acorns, or at cooking mescal. That was the old way, but we had our store to buy food in. Girls used to cook mud in cans on a fire. That was our food. When we made a fire, we made a very small one because our play wickiups were small. A few boys had those small, old-fashioned matches, but the rest of us had to get our fire at home and carry it down to where we played.


Older boys made knives out of tin cans. Only boys, not girls, did this. The knife was made by bending a piece of tin about the end of a stick, so that it stayed in place. One end of the stick served as a handle. The blade was curved and ground to an edge. The older boys who had these knives always carried them in their pockets, so that if they were out hunting and broke an arrow they could fashion another. They always had a pocketful of all kinds of birds' feathers, as well as sinew, so that they could repair or make new arrows at any time.


Boys, not girls, used to pretend to smoke. We would go along the riverbanks where the water had exposed the dry, pithy root of a cottonwood. We smoked sections of this just like a cigar, and in our store the storekeeper had them for sale. We used to take only a few puffs on them and throw them away. We also dried the leaves of¬†tc'√≠≈Çt'√≤j√©`¬†[‚Äúone sucks it‚Äù (sour dock)] and kept them in a little sack. We rolled cigarettes with these, using the paper from sugar or coffee packages which we picked up at home. Our families did not scold us for doing this. We didn't make ropes to play with. The girls used to make dolls. Little girls made dolls by bundling old rags together and tying them around the middle. Sometimes they made the hair of shredded cloth. We didn't paint our faces, but we used to tattoo marks on our skin‚Äîjust marks, not letters. We put them on our wrists, hands, and faces.


[Page 490]


Sometimes we played at having a social dance. We made a little drum out of a tin can. We put some water inside and stretched a piece of cloth across the mouth, tying it there. There would be a whole crowd of children, just like big people gathered at a dance. The boys would sing and sometimes the little girls would sing also. We sang old CJ37's songs, his lightning songs.¬†26¬†


Some of the little boys would tell the little girls to go out and start dancing. They would, several of them dancing back and forth together to the music. Then the boys would tell them to dance¬†≈Ç√†d√†tc'√¨tc'√πc¬†[a type of social dance], and the little girls would pick partners from among the boys to dance with them. Most of these children were from six to eight years old. Older children didn't take part in it. We danced in the daytime, right beside our own homes.


We never played at having a puberty ceremony for a girl, at holding curing ceremonies for sick people, at giving a hunting ceremony, or at singing deer, snake, or other such sacred songs. But we did play at giving the¬†g√°Àôn¬†dance and social dances. One boy called¬†nd√®Àôz√©`¬†[‚Äútall one‚Äù] was the leader in our community in any play of this sort. I guess he did not wish to play at curing rites or hunting ceremonies, or we might have done it. As he took the initiative in such things, we merely followed him. He was about sixteen at the time all this happened, and I must have been around ten. Some of the other boys were big boys, fourteen and fifteen years old.¬†nd√®Àôz√©`¬†is still living at Fort Apache. He used to pretend he was the father of John Roberson [a famous¬†g√°Àôn¬†shaman at that time] and knew all the¬†g√°Àôn¬†power. He made small¬†g√°Àôn¬†masks for us to wear from the left-over pieces when the men made real¬†g√°Àôn¬†masks for a ceremony. They were of the sotol stalk. We gave these¬†g√°Àôn¬†dances at night. We didn't even pretend to be curing anyone, but just gave them to have the dance.¬†nd√®Àôz√©`¬†himself painted the boys who were going to dance as¬†g√°Àôn.¬†When John Roberson's father used to paint his own dancers, at the end he put a dot of white paint on each of his cheeks and then ran the ends of his fingers dipped in white paint down the backs of his hands in a zigzag. So this boy used to do the same thing. Then he walked out to where we had the fire and called out¬†h√†g√∫Àô, h√†g√∫Àô,¬†just as John Roberson's father did. This was a signal for the impersonators to make their entry.


We used to hold this dance not far from our own homes.¬†nd√®Àôz√©`¬†sang for us. He sang real¬†g√°Àôn¬†songs, ones belonging to this same¬†g√°Àôn¬†shaman which he had picked up from hearing him sing them. He used to have a regular-sized drum made from a large can. He always brought it out when we had a dance. I don't know where he kept it. After the¬†g√°Àôn¬†dance was finished, we would have the circle dance.¬†27¬†


After the¬†[Page 491]¬†circle dance, we danced¬†≈Ç√®d√†tc'√¨tc'√πc.¬†Sometimes it used to turn into a real big dance, older youths and maidens coming down and joining in, helping to carry it through. We younger boys and girls would social dance also. Little girls walked up to a boy and touched him on the shoulder, inviting him to dance, just like grownups. But when only we younger children were playing at it, the dance petered out after a while. We would get tired of it. For the social dancing,¬†nd√®Àôz√©`¬†and some of the rest of us boys sang lightning songs, ones that belonged to the old man, CJ37. He knew we used them, but he didn't seem to mind. When the dance was finished, we put the¬†g√°Àôn¬†masks away in the brush for the night. The next morning we would conceal them where no one could find them, just as a real¬†g√°Àôn¬†shaman would do with his masks. Grownups didn't come to watch these dances of ours. They didn't seem to bother particularly about them, though sometimes our parents would tell us not to do it any more. But you know how kids are. They don't always obey their parents. We kept it up.


John Roberson's father used to give his¬†g√°Àôn¬†dance at almost every girl's puberty ceremony. After the ceremony he put the masks away in a cave across the river, not so far from where we lived. Other shamans who had ceremonial articles to be put away used the same cave. There was a great deal of ceremonial material in this cave.¬†28¬†


Sometimes when just we boys were off in the hills during the daytime, without any girls, we would go to this cave, take the masks out, put them on, and pretend to dance. This was under the leadership of¬†nd√®Àôz√©`.¬†But we never touched the hoops or crosses of the lightning shamans which were there. We were afraid of them.¬†29¬†


We fooled around with the masks for an hour or so and then put them back and went on our way.¬†30¬†





One time, I and some other boys went past this cave.¬†nd√®Àôz√©`,¬†who was with us, said, ‚ÄúCome on, let's have a dance.‚Äù We got the masks out, and he put them on us and painted us all up. We made dancing kilts by wrapping our shirts about our waists. Then he told us to wait there, that he was going off a little way, and, when he gave the call and started to sing, to come out and dance. We stood there, waiting. We waited and waited, but he did not call. Finally he took off the masks and went to see what was the matter. He was not there. He had played a joke and run off and left us. Not long after this, John Roberson's father must have found out what we boys had been doing. He must have dreamed about it, for he said, ‚ÄúSome boy is doing the same way I do.‚Äù He meant that someone had been using his masks.¬†[Page 492]¬†He was angry. But he didn't mind us children making our own small masks and putting on dances at home in which we used his songs. Later on, when¬†nd√®Àôz√©`¬†grew up, this same¬†g√°Àôn¬†shaman used him as a real¬†g√°Àôn¬†dancer. He was a very good one and danced many times, but he never became a¬†g√°Àôn¬†shaman.


There are no children's songs. The only songs that children sing are ones they hear grownups sing. I first started to sing when I was about six or seven. I sang a few songs such as the lightning songs of CJ37, but I only knew parts, not the whole song. I also was able to sing snatches of love songs that I had heard, but I couldn't sing any social dance songs. They were too hard. All of us kids would try to sing parts of such songs as these, but it wasn't until I was about ten that I first really started to learn whole songs. Old CJ37 often sang all night at curing or other ceremonies. He sang lightning songs and medicine songs, as well as others. We boys weren't meant to attend these ceremonies, but we did. The first song I learned to sing was a lightning song. We used to go to the curing ceremonies of CJ13, another shaman. He had all kinds of power for curing sicknesses: snake power, bear power, and others. From hearing these songs sung, we boys learned them. We could not sing the words, but we could sing the choruses. We used to try out one song at our play dances and sing it over and over again until we finally learned it. Then we would learn another and start using it.


We did not play at death and burial. We never did. I don't think it was because we were afraid of it. It was mainly because we never thought about playing that way. Besides, we didn't have the amount of sickness and death then that we have had since.


By the time I was old enough to join in the boys' war game [after eleven or twelve], boys had ceased playing it. But when I was a small boy, not yet old enough to join in, I can remember older boys playing it. Down at Dewey Flats, the Eastern White Mountain camps were on one side of the river, the Western White Mountain camps on the other. The boys from each side played this game against one another. They fought with slings and stones. The Yavapai, camped on the river below us, fought the Arivaipa boys near them in the same way. Big boys and sometimes men took part. Once I was swimming in the river with another small boy. We had no clothes on. A Yavapai youth came along and slung a stone at us. We got up and ran. We tried to throw rocks at him, but missed. We escaped into some thick brush and lay there. He could not see us but slung a stone blindly into the thicket. It hit me right on the buttocks. Years later I met this Yavapai as a man. We talked about that time and laughed.


When I was a boy of ten or so, I used to pretend to play at ‚Äúhidden-ball‚Äù with other boys my age. We didn't play with moccasins but hid¬†[Page 493]¬†the ball in the ground. We learned this game from the San Carlos people. We used to go and watch grown men playing it, for they played it not far from the camps. That's how we learned it. After watching a game among the men, boys were likely to start one of their own the next day. We played either during the day or at night, sometimes inside the wickiup. But we just played a little while and then quit. We would bet arrows and marbles with each other. Little girls came and watched us, just like women do at a real game, but they never played. When I was older, I and other boys my age played at hoop-and-poles. But until boys were about fifteen years old they never played this game. It was a man's game. I can remember when I and two friends of mine played it. We had a set of poles made of batamota, and our hoop was of mesquite root. Sometimes, boys made their hoop-and-poles of willow. A boy who owned a set always took it home with him at night after the game, just as a man would do. We had lots of fun playing at this game. There would be a whole lot of boys, just as there were many men about a hoop-and-poles course when they played. We knew exactly how to play it, and our hoops had ‚Äúbig bead‚Äù in the middle, with fifty beads, sometimes sixty-one beads, on each side.¬†31¬†


We gambled, betting our marbles and tops, but we never pretended to have gambling power for this game. We didn't know about that. Boys weren't allowed to use a real set of hoop-and-poles for fear they would damage them. Just as no women or girls were allowed around when men played hoop-and-poles, we boys didn't let any girls come where we were playing.


Up to ten years old or so boys and girls very often played together, but after eleven or twelve they separated. The sort of play I have told you about [all the preceding, excluding the hoop-and-poles game, the play with the real¬†g√°Àôn¬†masks, and the boy's war game] was mainly girls and boys together. Boys alone didn't play at family, marriage, cooking, making wickiups, or rations. After a boy was eleven or twelve, he spent most of his time going about in groups with other boys, hunting birds and small animals, sometimes all day and even at night, or playing certain boy's games which I will tell you about. Girls played separately from big boys after this age also. Many girls played until they were fifteen or so. They made wickiups just as we did when younger, but these were larger and better made, about six feet high. Inside they played at household with little children, both boys and girls, though these little kids were just there mainly to watch them. That's the way small children learn to play. The big girls would play at cooking. They didn't pretend mud was their food, the way small children do, but they boiled water, pretending it was tulibai and such things. They used to¬†[Page [facing p.494]]


PLATE VIII


PLAYING AT COOKING


[Page 494]¬†make dolls, really good ones, and clothe them in girl's dresses which they sewed. They made the hair of real hair so that it hung down the back. They made miniature moccasins of buckskin for them. They knew how to make good dolls.


We big boys used to hunt kangaroo rats out in the brush at night-time. We didn't eat them. We just killed them. One time a bunch of us boys went across the river from Dewey Flats and killed a whole sackful. There was an old woman living near by who was so old that she was in her second childhood. She spent most of her time asleep. That night we crept into her wickiup and put the sack of rats at the side of her bed as she slept. She slept with the kangaroo rats all night, not knowing it. Next morning I guess she was mad when she found out. Sometimes we boys hunted quail at night. We crossed back and forth across the Gila River as many as two and three times in a night doing this, even in wintertime. I and one of my cross-cousins were out like this one night. We thought we saw a duck in the river. We shot at it. It was just an old stick. We lost our arrow and so we built a fire and made another one by its light. At other times we went up toward Turn-bull Mountain, where there were many cactus plants growing. The quail roosted on these, and we killed them. Sometimes three or four of us would ride burros out into the hills to shoot doves during their nesting season. They were easy to hit when they sat on the nest. When we went out in the hills to hunt, the oldest boy was always the leader. We went where he said. When we killed birds, sometimes we would stop and cook and eat them.


We used to play at renegades and soldiers. CJ30 played with us. He was a lot older than the rest of us. He always used to take the part of Apache Kid, and one other boy always took the part of a Chiricahua renegade. The rest of us were soldiers and scouts and would try to capture these two. There were two hills where we usually played this game. The renegades would come out on the side of one hill and holler at us. Then they would come out on the other side of the hill and shout. We used horse manure as bullets. If you got hit by one of these bullets, you were dead right there. For our captain we had one lame boy. There were boys older than he who could have been captain, but we made him captain because he could not travel fast and was always in the rear.¬†32¬†





We always played this game at night. One evening when we were playing we saw a man coming riding toward us. We could see the glint of his rifle barrel in the moonlight. It was only the older brother of Elton Causey coming home from a party, but, thinking it was really Apache Kid, we got scared and all ran off. Our captain was left behind. He hollered at us. Later, the same evening, the oldest¬†[Page [facing p. 495]]


PLATE IX


CHILDREN AT PLAY


[Page 495]¬†boys among us went up to where some white men, freighting with wagons, had camped for the night. They crept into the camp and stole some biscuits out of a dutch oven. They took a can of salt too. They brought this back to where the rest of us were waiting. We split the biscuits up between us, put salt on them, and ate them. Each one of us got one. This was to feed us soldiers. The white men must have been very sound asleep. The next morning a white man from the camp climbed up on top of a hill where he could overlook our camps. He thought we had taken the biscuits, but he didn't say anything.


One time I, Charley Sago,¬†nd√®Àôz√©`,¬†and some other boys went down river to where the Yavapai were living. We hung about all day. We saw that the Yavapai had a lot of good melons in their fields. We waited until night and then went into the fields and ate our fill of them. We gathered more melons and took them up to where some Mexican freighters were camped on the road. They gave us a meal and some sugar and coffee in exchange for the melons. We left, and after we had gone a little way we could hear the Mexicans commence to shout. We thought that the Yavapai must have found the Mexicans with their melons and that they would soon be on our trail. We ran for it. After a while we heard someone coming on horseback, so we split up. It was too dark to see. When the rider was close, one of the boys hollered, ‚ÄúHello.‚Äù The man answered ‚ÄúHello‚Äù and went on. After going a way farther, we stopped and built a fire to warm ourselves. From there we went to our homes. When I got home, I found mother telling stories with an old woman. That's the way old women used to do. They had cooked up some corn and were eating it. I had some of the coffee and sugar tied in the corner of my shirt. Mother asked me where I got it, and I told her that the Mexicans had given it to me. But I really got it for the melons I had stolen.


I can't remember the children that I played with before I was ten, but from then on, until I went off to school at fourteen, my two best friends were Paul Nosey and Elton Causey. The first died in school.¬†33¬†


The second didn't go to school at the same time I did, but not long after that mother told me he went to our camp and lay down on my bed and told her, ‚ÄúWell, I guess I'll go to school also.‚Äù He didn't have to go, but he wanted to be with me. The first I knew of it, I saw him there at the school, with his hair already cut like a schoolboy. All three of us were of the same band. We always went about together. Paul was my cross-cousin by clan because his clan was related to that of my father. He was also the son of my mother's half-sister's son. Because of this, our families always camped close together, and that is how I got to know him so well. Elton was of the same clan as Paul and so was also¬†[Page 496]¬†my cross-cousin. Whenever we traveled, Elton and his mother used to accompany us, as she was a great friend of my mother's.


Another boy whom I went about with a great deal was the younger brother of Henry Hudson. He was of my father's clan [also a cross-cousin]. There was a boy named Calvin I used to see a lot of. His father's clan and my father's clan were the same, so we were parallel cousins, but I didn't know he was my brother in this way until very much later.¬†nd√®Àôz√©`,¬†the boy who used to be the leader of the¬†g√°Àôn¬†dances, was also a parallel cousin of mine for the same reason. This I did not know until we had grown up. There were other boys we saw, but I saw most of the first four above. There must have been about twenty-five of us boys who played around together. We were of varying ages. We didn't always play together, but often split up to play in small groups because some would want to go one way, some another. Some days there wasn't anything doing at all, and at other times fathers wouldn't let their boys go off to play because they had work for them to do, such as going after the horses. But whenever we played at games such as scouts and renegades, or held a dance, all of us would be there.


24In connection with a child's knowledge of social practices, Neil Buck once remarked, ‚ÄúAs a small boy I heard older people use the expression which signifies that a widow has been reclaimed in marriage by some kinsman of her dead husband. I used to wonder what it meant, and it was several years before I found out.‚Äù


25¬†Notice that the store is at a distance from the camp, just as it should be. Charge accounts are now the most common way of doing business, although they were less common in former times.

The material represents the period from 1893 to 1903. This, of course, was twenty years after the establishment of the San Carlos Reservation, when reservation life had settled into a groove of its own:


We children used to go to the edge of the river where the willows grew. There we made play wickiups of the willows and pretended to live as older people do. Boys and girls used to get married. Although we didn't exchange gifts such as horses at these marriages, we exchanged food and drink. The boy's family would prepare tulibai. There would be twenty-five mounds of earth piled up in a line, each representing one can of tulibai. The man whose daughter was to be married was invited to bring his family over to drink them. As each can was finished, the mound of earth was obliterated. A little later, the girl's family would prepare a great feast and invite the boy's family over. They had round¬†[Page 487]¬†flat pieces of limestone for the dishes and on each would be a different kind of make-believe food. When we got there, they would point out each kind to us, saying, ‚ÄúThis is walnuts; this is acorn meal and stewed meat.‚Äù


When a boy married, he never married his own sister. We knew about that. But we never thought about clan exogamy, and it didn't matter to us whether two children married who were of the same clan. We didn't pretend that they were of different clans. Also, we boys didn't avoid our own blood sisters, nor they us. We were too young for that. We didn't even pretend to avoid them. We began to think about that much later. We didn't joke our real cross-cousins then, either. We were too young.¬†24¬†





A boy had to respect his parents-in-law and avoid his mother-in-law, so his camp was built at a little distance from that of his wife's parents. Though we called each other by our regular names in play when we wanted to, a man couldn't call the names of his parents-in-law, just as it is with grownups. He called them¬†c√†Àôd√†Àôn√≠`¬†[proper affinal term]. We had brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law whom we called¬†c√¨Œ≥√≠Àô¬†[proper affinal term] as well. We used to pretend that a man had obligations to his father-in-law. We had a play store, and he would have to go to the store all the time to buy things for his father-in-law. When we played family, we pretended we had children, but we never pretended that a woman was pregnant or that she gave birth to a baby. We didn't play that the youngest child was the favorite either, as it is among grownups.


I can remember one time when I was a small kid and we were playing family. One girl of the¬†n√°Œ≥√≤d√®sg√¨jn¬†clan was my mother. There were a lot of other small boys there. We made three or four little piles of dirt, calling them cans of tulibai. When we finished one can, we leveled the pile. Soon we all said we were drunk. I was my mother's only child, so I was alone. The other boys pretended to start a fight with me. They all jumped on me. The girl who was my mother hollered at the top of her lungs as a grown person would do, ‚ÄúThe¬†'√¨y√†`'√°iy‚ñ°¬†[clan] boys are fighting my son.‚Äù She shouted so loud that my real mother and older sister back at camp heard her. They used to laugh afterward when they told about it. But we didn't play at having clan blood-feuds. Maybe some children did, but then, you know, not all children play in the same way.





When we played at family and camp life, we did not pretend that one of us was chief and that others were wealthy, influential men, but we¬†[Page 488]¬†used to have police. When a man had tulibai, these police sometimes came around and caught him. Then the policeman would dump out the tulibai and arrest the man. The tulibai was muddy water. We had a place we pretended was the guardhouse, and the man would be put in there for three or four days. At this guardhouse food was given to the prisoners. We played at issuing rations also, just as they really did at the agency. The rations were issued to us by our police at the guardhouse. We used to ride to the guardhouse on willow sticks, which we said were horses, to receive our rations. The children would all line up in front of the guardhouse to get their rations. One policeman was detailed to watch the line and prevent any trouble which might arise, just as they really did at the agency, and a second issued the rations to us. We did not play school.


We didn't play at having cattle or burros or dogs, but we did play at horses. One boy would be sent out to drive the horses into camp. He would come in, bringing an armful of willow branches. These were the horses. Ration time would be coming round, so we would need the horses to ride in on to get rations. Men and their wives started off riding. If we had to stop on the way for the night, we tied our horses to a tree. Then we would pull up a few handfuls of grass and leave them there for the horse to eat, just as we had seen our elders do.


We boys also used to make wagons out of tin cans. That was before the railroad came through, and we used to see many teams go by on the way to San Carlos and Globe, hauling freight. They would camp along the road and leave tin cans. We made the wagons of these tin cans. We put the can in a fire and heated it until the solder at both ends melted, and the two round ends came loose. These we made into wheels, punching a hole through the centers for the axle. The rest of the tin we flattened out straight. Then we bent each edge down on the long sides. We punched other holes in the bent-down edges, so we could run sticks through for the axles and attach the wheels. We put two wheels in front and only one in back. Through the sides of the wagon bottom we struck upright poles to hold the loads on, just like a real wagon. Almost every boy had one of these. We used to pretend to haul loads of wood on them, lengths of greasewood about seven inches long. We hauled them to the store to sell to the storekeeper. Sometimes we boys played with the wagons by ourselves without girls, pretending that we were freighting. One boy would go ahead, the others following in a long line along the road, just as we had seen freighters go by. We were hauling to the store. When we played at home where the dogs were, we used to make believe they were horses, and pack loads on them. But the dogs would not follow us away from camp, so we had to use willow branches for horses elsewhere.


After we had been playing family and camps down by the river a¬†[Page 489]¬†while, one of the older boys would say he was going to be a white man and run a store. He would make a little inclosure by setting sticks up in the ground. This was the store. Inside, he used sticks to make a sort of shelf to put his goods on. He made things out of mud. These, and stones, were the store goods. The store was always about two hundred yards distant from our camps. When we went to the store to buy things, we used small stones for money. We didn't have any charge accounts.¬†25


We never played at hunting large game such as deer, but all boys had bows and arrows and used to go out hunting small game. We really did it; we didn't play at it. We did not play at having farms and raising crops,


BOY'S KNIFE


at going out to gather wild seeds and acorns, or at cooking mescal. That was the old way, but we had our store to buy food in. Girls used to cook mud in cans on a fire. That was our food. When we made a fire, we made a very small one because our play wickiups were small. A few boys had those small, old-fashioned matches, but the rest of us had to get our fire at home and carry it down to where we played.


Older boys made knives out of tin cans. Only boys, not girls, did this. The knife was made by bending a piece of tin about the end of a stick, so that it stayed in place. One end of the stick served as a handle. The blade was curved and ground to an edge. The older boys who had these knives always carried them in their pockets, so that if they were out hunting and broke an arrow they could fashion another. They always had a pocketful of all kinds of birds' feathers, as well as sinew, so that they could repair or make new arrows at any time.


Boys, not girls, used to pretend to smoke. We would go along the riverbanks where the water had exposed the dry, pithy root of a cottonwood. We smoked sections of this just like a cigar, and in our store the storekeeper had them for sale. We used to take only a few puffs on them and throw them away. We also dried the leaves of¬†tc'√≠≈Çt'√≤j√©`¬†[‚Äúone sucks it‚Äù (sour dock)] and kept them in a little sack. We rolled cigarettes with these, using the paper from sugar or coffee packages which we picked up at home. Our families did not scold us for doing this. We didn't make ropes to play with. The girls used to make dolls. Little girls made dolls by bundling old rags together and tying them around the middle. Sometimes they made the hair of shredded cloth. We didn't paint our faces, but we used to tattoo marks on our skin‚Äîjust marks, not letters. We put them on our wrists, hands, and faces.


[Page 490]


Sometimes we played at having a social dance. We made a little drum out of a tin can. We put some water inside and stretched a piece of cloth across the mouth, tying it there. There would be a whole crowd of children, just like big people gathered at a dance. The boys would sing and sometimes the little girls would sing also. We sang old CJ37's songs, his lightning songs.¬†26¬†


Some of the little boys would tell the little girls to go out and start dancing. They would, several of them dancing back and forth together to the music. Then the boys would tell them to dance¬†≈Ç√†d√†tc'√¨tc'√πc¬†[a type of social dance], and the little girls would pick partners from among the boys to dance with them. Most of these children were from six to eight years old. Older children didn't take part in it. We danced in the daytime, right beside our own homes.


We never played at having a puberty ceremony for a girl, at holding curing ceremonies for sick people, at giving a hunting ceremony, or at singing deer, snake, or other such sacred songs. But we did play at giving the¬†g√°Àôn¬†dance and social dances. One boy called¬†nd√®Àôz√©`¬†[‚Äútall one‚Äù] was the leader in our community in any play of this sort. I guess he did not wish to play at curing rites or hunting ceremonies, or we might have done it. As he took the initiative in such things, we merely followed him. He was about sixteen at the time all this happened, and I must have been around ten. Some of the other boys were big boys, fourteen and fifteen years old.¬†nd√®Àôz√©`¬†is still living at Fort Apache. He used to pretend he was the father of John Roberson [a famous¬†g√°Àôn¬†shaman at that time] and knew all the¬†g√°Àôn¬†power. He made small¬†g√°Àôn¬†masks for us to wear from the left-over pieces when the men made real¬†g√°Àôn¬†masks for a ceremony. They were of the sotol stalk. We gave these¬†g√°Àôn¬†dances at night. We didn't even pretend to be curing anyone, but just gave them to have the dance.¬†nd√®Àôz√©`¬†himself painted the boys who were going to dance as¬†g√°Àôn.¬†When John Roberson's father used to paint his own dancers, at the end he put a dot of white paint on each of his cheeks and then ran the ends of his fingers dipped in white paint down the backs of his hands in a zigzag. So this boy used to do the same thing. Then he walked out to where we had the fire and called out¬†h√†g√∫Àô, h√†g√∫Àô,¬†just as John Roberson's father did. This was a signal for the impersonators to make their entry.


We used to hold this dance not far from our own homes.¬†nd√®Àôz√©`¬†sang for us. He sang real¬†g√°Àôn¬†songs, ones belonging to this same¬†g√°Àôn¬†shaman which he had picked up from hearing him sing them. He used to have a regular-sized drum made from a large can. He always brought it out when we had a dance. I don't know where he kept it. After the¬†g√°Àôn¬†dance was finished, we would have the circle dance.¬†27¬†


After the¬†[Page 491]¬†circle dance, we danced¬†≈Ç√®d√†tc'√¨tc'√πc.¬†Sometimes it used to turn into a real big dance, older youths and maidens coming down and joining in, helping to carry it through. We younger boys and girls would social dance also. Little girls walked up to a boy and touched him on the shoulder, inviting him to dance, just like grownups. But when only we younger children were playing at it, the dance petered out after a while. We would get tired of it. For the social dancing,¬†nd√®Àôz√©`¬†and some of the rest of us boys sang lightning songs, ones that belonged to the old man, CJ37. He knew we used them, but he didn't seem to mind. When the dance was finished, we put the¬†g√°Àôn¬†masks away in the brush for the night. The next morning we would conceal them where no one could find them, just as a real¬†g√°Àôn¬†shaman would do with his masks. Grownups didn't come to watch these dances of ours. They didn't seem to bother particularly about them, though sometimes our parents would tell us not to do it any more. But you know how kids are. They don't always obey their parents. We kept it up.


John Roberson's father used to give his¬†g√°Àôn¬†dance at almost every girl's puberty ceremony. After the ceremony he put the masks away in a cave across the river, not so far from where we lived. Other shamans who had ceremonial articles to be put away used the same cave. There was a great deal of ceremonial material in this cave.¬†28¬†


Sometimes when just we boys were off in the hills during the daytime, without any girls, we would go to this cave, take the masks out, put them on, and pretend to dance. This was under the leadership of¬†nd√®Àôz√©`.¬†But we never touched the hoops or crosses of the lightning shamans which were there. We were afraid of them.¬†29¬†


We fooled around with the masks for an hour or so and then put them back and went on our way.¬†30¬†





One time, I and some other boys went past this cave.¬†nd√®Àôz√©`,¬†who was with us, said, ‚ÄúCome on, let's have a dance.‚Äù We got the masks out, and he put them on us and painted us all up. We made dancing kilts by wrapping our shirts about our waists. Then he told us to wait there, that he was going off a little way, and, when he gave the call and started to sing, to come out and dance. We stood there, waiting. We waited and waited, but he did not call. Finally he took off the masks and went to see what was the matter. He was not there. He had played a joke and run off and left us. Not long after this, John Roberson's father must have found out what we boys had been doing. He must have dreamed about it, for he said, ‚ÄúSome boy is doing the same way I do.‚Äù He meant that someone had been using his masks.¬†[Page 492]¬†He was angry. But he didn't mind us children making our own small masks and putting on dances at home in which we used his songs. Later on, when¬†nd√®Àôz√©`¬†grew up, this same¬†g√°Àôn¬†shaman used him as a real¬†g√°Àôn¬†dancer. He was a very good one and danced many times, but he never became a¬†g√°Àôn¬†shaman.


There are no children's songs. The only songs that children sing are ones they hear grownups sing. I first started to sing when I was about six or seven. I sang a few songs such as the lightning songs of CJ37, but I only knew parts, not the whole song. I also was able to sing snatches of love songs that I had heard, but I couldn't sing any social dance songs. They were too hard. All of us kids would try to sing parts of such songs as these, but it wasn't until I was about ten that I first really started to learn whole songs. Old CJ37 often sang all night at curing or other ceremonies. He sang lightning songs and medicine songs, as well as others. We boys weren't meant to attend these ceremonies, but we did. The first song I learned to sing was a lightning song. We used to go to the curing ceremonies of CJ13, another shaman. He had all kinds of power for curing sicknesses: snake power, bear power, and others. From hearing these songs sung, we boys learned them. We could not sing the words, but we could sing the choruses. We used to try out one song at our play dances and sing it over and over again until we finally learned it. Then we would learn another and start using it.


We did not play at death and burial. We never did. I don't think it was because we were afraid of it. It was mainly because we never thought about playing that way. Besides, we didn't have the amount of sickness and death then that we have had since.


By the time I was old enough to join in the boys' war game [after eleven or twelve], boys had ceased playing it. But when I was a small boy, not yet old enough to join in, I can remember older boys playing it. Down at Dewey Flats, the Eastern White Mountain camps were on one side of the river, the Western White Mountain camps on the other. The boys from each side played this game against one another. They fought with slings and stones. The Yavapai, camped on the river below us, fought the Arivaipa boys near them in the same way. Big boys and sometimes men took part. Once I was swimming in the river with another small boy. We had no clothes on. A Yavapai youth came along and slung a stone at us. We got up and ran. We tried to throw rocks at him, but missed. We escaped into some thick brush and lay there. He could not see us but slung a stone blindly into the thicket. It hit me right on the buttocks. Years later I met this Yavapai as a man. We talked about that time and laughed.


When I was a boy of ten or so, I used to pretend to play at ‚Äúhidden-ball‚Äù with other boys my age. We didn't play with moccasins but hid¬†[Page 493]¬†the ball in the ground. We learned this game from the San Carlos people. We used to go and watch grown men playing it, for they played it not far from the camps. That's how we learned it. After watching a game among the men, boys were likely to start one of their own the next day. We played either during the day or at night, sometimes inside the wickiup. But we just played a little while and then quit. We would bet arrows and marbles with each other. Little girls came and watched us, just like women do at a real game, but they never played. When I was older, I and other boys my age played at hoop-and-poles. But until boys were about fifteen years old they never played this game. It was a man's game. I can remember when I and two friends of mine played it. We had a set of poles made of batamota, and our hoop was of mesquite root. Sometimes, boys made their hoop-and-poles of willow. A boy who owned a set always took it home with him at night after the game, just as a man would do. We had lots of fun playing at this game. There would be a whole lot of boys, just as there were many men about a hoop-and-poles course when they played. We knew exactly how to play it, and our hoops had ‚Äúbig bead‚Äù in the middle, with fifty beads, sometimes sixty-one beads, on each side.¬†31¬†


We gambled, betting our marbles and tops, but we never pretended to have gambling power for this game. We didn't know about that. Boys weren't allowed to use a real set of hoop-and-poles for fear they would damage them. Just as no women or girls were allowed around when men played hoop-and-poles, we boys didn't let any girls come where we were playing.


Up to ten years old or so boys and girls very often played together, but after eleven or twelve they separated. The sort of play I have told you about [all the preceding, excluding the hoop-and-poles game, the play with the real¬†g√°Àôn¬†masks, and the boy's war game] was mainly girls and boys together. Boys alone didn't play at family, marriage, cooking, making wickiups, or rations. After a boy was eleven or twelve, he spent most of his time going about in groups with other boys, hunting birds and small animals, sometimes all day and even at night, or playing certain boy's games which I will tell you about. Girls played separately from big boys after this age also. Many girls played until they were fifteen or so. They made wickiups just as we did when younger, but these were larger and better made, about six feet high. Inside they played at household with little children, both boys and girls, though these little kids were just there mainly to watch them. That's the way small children learn to play. The big girls would play at cooking. They didn't pretend mud was their food, the way small children do, but they boiled water, pretending it was tulibai and such things. They used to¬†[Page [facing p.494]]


PLATE VIII


PLAYING AT COOKING


[Page 494]¬†make dolls, really good ones, and clothe them in girl's dresses which they sewed. They made the hair of real hair so that it hung down the back. They made miniature moccasins of buckskin for them. They knew how to make good dolls.


We big boys used to hunt kangaroo rats out in the brush at night-time. We didn't eat them. We just killed them. One time a bunch of us boys went across the river from Dewey Flats and killed a whole sackful. There was an old woman living near by who was so old that she was in her second childhood. She spent most of her time asleep. That night we crept into her wickiup and put the sack of rats at the side of her bed as she slept. She slept with the kangaroo rats all night, not knowing it. Next morning I guess she was mad when she found out. Sometimes we boys hunted quail at night. We crossed back and forth across the Gila River as many as two and three times in a night doing this, even in wintertime. I and one of my cross-cousins were out like this one night. We thought we saw a duck in the river. We shot at it. It was just an old stick. We lost our arrow and so we built a fire and made another one by its light. At other times we went up toward Turn-bull Mountain, where there were many cactus plants growing. The quail roosted on these, and we killed them. Sometimes three or four of us would ride burros out into the hills to shoot doves during their nesting season. They were easy to hit when they sat on the nest. When we went out in the hills to hunt, the oldest boy was always the leader. We went where he said. When we killed birds, sometimes we would stop and cook and eat them.


We used to play at renegades and soldiers. CJ30 played with us. He was a lot older than the rest of us. He always used to take the part of Apache Kid, and one other boy always took the part of a Chiricahua renegade. The rest of us were soldiers and scouts and would try to capture these two. There were two hills where we usually played this game. The renegades would come out on the side of one hill and holler at us. Then they would come out on the other side of the hill and shout. We used horse manure as bullets. If you got hit by one of these bullets, you were dead right there. For our captain we had one lame boy. There were boys older than he who could have been captain, but we made him captain because he could not travel fast and was always in the rear.¬†32¬†





We always played this game at night. One evening when we were playing we saw a man coming riding toward us. We could see the glint of his rifle barrel in the moonlight. It was only the older brother of Elton Causey coming home from a party, but, thinking it was really Apache Kid, we got scared and all ran off. Our captain was left behind. He hollered at us. Later, the same evening, the oldest¬†[Page [facing p. 495]]


PLATE IX


CHILDREN AT PLAY


[Page 495]¬†boys among us went up to where some white men, freighting with wagons, had camped for the night. They crept into the camp and stole some biscuits out of a dutch oven. They took a can of salt too. They brought this back to where the rest of us were waiting. We split the biscuits up between us, put salt on them, and ate them. Each one of us got one. This was to feed us soldiers. The white men must have been very sound asleep. The next morning a white man from the camp climbed up on top of a hill where he could overlook our camps. He thought we had taken the biscuits, but he didn't say anything.


One time I, Charley Sago,¬†nd√®Àôz√©`,¬†and some other boys went down river to where the Yavapai were living. We hung about all day. We saw that the Yavapai had a lot of good melons in their fields. We waited until night and then went into the fields and ate our fill of them. We gathered more melons and took them up to where some Mexican freighters were camped on the road. They gave us a meal and some sugar and coffee in exchange for the melons. We left, and after we had gone a little way we could hear the Mexicans commence to shout. We thought that the Yavapai must have found the Mexicans with their melons and that they would soon be on our trail. We ran for it. After a while we heard someone coming on horseback, so we split up. It was too dark to see. When the rider was close, one of the boys hollered, ‚ÄúHello.‚Äù The man answered ‚ÄúHello‚Äù and went on. After going a way farther, we stopped and built a fire to warm ourselves. From there we went to our homes. When I got home, I found mother telling stories with an old woman. That's the way old women used to do. They had cooked up some corn and were eating it. I had some of the coffee and sugar tied in the corner of my shirt. Mother asked me where I got it, and I told her that the Mexicans had given it to me. But I really got it for the melons I had stolen.


I can't remember the children that I played with before I was ten, but from then on, until I went off to school at fourteen, my two best friends were Paul Nosey and Elton Causey. The first died in school.¬†33¬†


The second didn't go to school at the same time I did, but not long after that mother told me he went to our camp and lay down on my bed and told her, ‚ÄúWell, I guess I'll go to school also.‚Äù He didn't have to go, but he wanted to be with me. The first I knew of it, I saw him there at the school, with his hair already cut like a schoolboy. All three of us were of the same band. We always went about together. Paul was my cross-cousin by clan because his clan was related to that of my father. He was also the son of my mother's half-sister's son. Because of this, our families always camped close together, and that is how I got to know him so well. Elton was of the same clan as Paul and so was also¬†[Page 496]¬†my cross-cousin. Whenever we traveled, Elton and his mother used to accompany us, as she was a great friend of my mother's.


Another boy whom I went about with a great deal was the younger brother of Henry Hudson. He was of my father's clan [also a cross-cousin]. There was a boy named Calvin I used to see a lot of. His father's clan and my father's clan were the same, so we were parallel cousins, but I didn't know he was my brother in this way until very much later.¬†nd√®Àôz√©`,¬†the boy who used to be the leader of the¬†g√°Àôn¬†dances, was also a parallel cousin of mine for the same reason. This I did not know until we had grown up. There were other boys we saw, but I saw most of the first four above. There must have been about twenty-five of us boys who played around together. We were of varying ages. We didn't always play together, but often split up to play in small groups because some would want to go one way, some another. Some days there wasn't anything doing at all, and at other times fathers wouldn't let their boys go off to play because they had work for them to do, such as going after the horses. But whenever we played at games such as scouts and renegades, or held a dance, all of us would be there.


24In connection with a child's knowledge of social practices, Neil Buck once remarked, ‚ÄúAs a small boy I heard older people use the expression which signifies that a widow has been reclaimed in marriage by some kinsman of her dead husband. I used to wonder what it meant, and it was several years before I found out.‚Äù


25¬†Notice that the store is at a distance from the camp, just as it should be. Charge accounts are now the most common way of doing business, although they were less common in former times.

The material represents the period from 1893 to 1903. This, of course, was twenty years after the establishment of the San Carlos Reservation, when reservation life had settled into a groove of its own:


We children used to go to the edge of the river where the willows grew. There we made play wickiups of the willows and pretended to live as older people do. Boys and girls used to get married. Although we didn't exchange gifts such as horses at these marriages, we exchanged food and drink. The boy's family would prepare tulibai. There would be twenty-five mounds of earth piled up in a line, each representing one can of tulibai. The man whose daughter was to be married was invited to bring his family over to drink them. As each can was finished, the mound of earth was obliterated. A little later, the girl's family would prepare a great feast and invite the boy's family over. They had round¬†[Page 487]¬†flat pieces of limestone for the dishes and on each would be a different kind of make-believe food. When we got there, they would point out each kind to us, saying, ‚ÄúThis is walnuts; this is acorn meal and stewed meat.‚Äù


When a boy married, he never married his own sister. We knew about that. But we never thought about clan exogamy, and it didn't matter to us whether two children married who were of the same clan. We didn't pretend that they were of different clans. Also, we boys didn't avoid our own blood sisters, nor they us. We were too young for that. We didn't even pretend to avoid them. We began to think about that much later. We didn't joke our real cross-cousins then, either. We were too young.¬†24¬†





A boy had to respect his parents-in-law and avoid his mother-in-law, so his camp was built at a little distance from that of his wife's parents. Though we called each other by our regular names in play when we wanted to, a man couldn't call the names of his parents-in-law, just as it is with grownups. He called them¬†c√†Àôd√†Àôn√≠`¬†[proper affinal term]. We had brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law whom we called¬†c√¨Œ≥√≠Àô¬†[proper affinal term] as well. We used to pretend that a man had obligations to his father-in-law. We had a play store, and he would have to go to the store all the time to buy things for his father-in-law. When we played family, we pretended we had children, but we never pretended that a woman was pregnant or that she gave birth to a baby. We didn't play that the youngest child was the favorite either, as it is among grownups.


I can remember one time when I was a small kid and we were playing family. One girl of the¬†n√°Œ≥√≤d√®sg√¨jn¬†clan was my mother. There were a lot of other small boys there. We made three or four little piles of dirt, calling them cans of tulibai. When we finished one can, we leveled the pile. Soon we all said we were drunk. I was my mother's only child, so I was alone. The other boys pretended to start a fight with me. They all jumped on me. The girl who was my mother hollered at the top of her lungs as a grown person would do, ‚ÄúThe¬†'√¨y√†`'√°iy‚ñ°¬†[clan] boys are fighting my son.‚Äù She shouted so loud that my real mother and older sister back at camp heard her. They used to laugh afterward when they told about it. But we didn't play at having clan blood-feuds. Maybe some children did, but then, you know, not all children play in the same way.





When we played at family and camp life, we did not pretend that one of us was chief and that others were wealthy, influential men, but we¬†[Page 488]¬†used to have police. When a man had tulibai, these police sometimes came around and caught him. Then the policeman would dump out the tulibai and arrest the man. The tulibai was muddy water. We had a place we pretended was the guardhouse, and the man would be put in there for three or four days. At this guardhouse food was given to the prisoners. We played at issuing rations also, just as they really did at the agency. The rations were issued to us by our police at the guardhouse. We used to ride to the guardhouse on willow sticks, which we said were horses, to receive our rations. The children would all line up in front of the guardhouse to get their rations. One policeman was detailed to watch the line and prevent any trouble which might arise, just as they really did at the agency, and a second issued the rations to us. We did not play school.


We didn't play at having cattle or burros or dogs, but we did play at horses. One boy would be sent out to drive the horses into camp. He would come in, bringing an armful of willow branches. These were the horses. Ration time would be coming round, so we would need the horses to ride in on to get rations. Men and their wives started off riding. If we had to stop on the way for the night, we tied our horses to a tree. Then we would pull up a few handfuls of grass and leave them there for the horse to eat, just as we had seen our elders do.


We boys also used to make wagons out of tin cans. That was before the railroad came through, and we used to see many teams go by on the way to San Carlos and Globe, hauling freight. They would camp along the road and leave tin cans. We made the wagons of these tin cans. We put the can in a fire and heated it until the solder at both ends melted, and the two round ends came loose. These we made into wheels, punching a hole through the centers for the axle. The rest of the tin we flattened out straight. Then we bent each edge down on the long sides. We punched other holes in the bent-down edges, so we could run sticks through for the axles and attach the wheels. We put two wheels in front and only one in back. Through the sides of the wagon bottom we struck upright poles to hold the loads on, just like a real wagon. Almost every boy had one of these. We used to pretend to haul loads of wood on them, lengths of greasewood about seven inches long. We hauled them to the store to sell to the storekeeper. Sometimes we boys played with the wagons by ourselves without girls, pretending that we were freighting. One boy would go ahead, the others following in a long line along the road, just as we had seen freighters go by. We were hauling to the store. When we played at home where the dogs were, we used to make believe they were horses, and pack loads on them. But the dogs would not follow us away from camp, so we had to use willow branches for horses elsewhere.


After we had been playing family and camps down by the river a¬†[Page 489]¬†while, one of the older boys would say he was going to be a white man and run a store. He would make a little inclosure by setting sticks up in the ground. This was the store. Inside, he used sticks to make a sort of shelf to put his goods on. He made things out of mud. These, and stones, were the store goods. The store was always about two hundred yards distant from our camps. When we went to the store to buy things, we used small stones for money. We didn't have any charge accounts.¬†25


We never played at hunting large game such as deer, but all boys had bows and arrows and used to go out hunting small game. We really did it; we didn't play at it. We did not play at having farms and raising crops,


BOY'S KNIFE


at going out to gather wild seeds and acorns, or at cooking mescal. That was the old way, but we had our store to buy food in. Girls used to cook mud in cans on a fire. That was our food. When we made a fire, we made a very small one because our play wickiups were small. A few boys had those small, old-fashioned matches, but the rest of us had to get our fire at home and carry it down to where we played.


Older boys made knives out of tin cans. Only boys, not girls, did this. The knife was made by bending a piece of tin about the end of a stick, so that it stayed in place. One end of the stick served as a handle. The blade was curved and ground to an edge. The older boys who had these knives always carried them in their pockets, so that if they were out hunting and broke an arrow they could fashion another. They always had a pocketful of all kinds of birds' feathers, as well as sinew, so that they could repair or make new arrows at any time.


Boys, not girls, used to pretend to smoke. We would go along the riverbanks where the water had exposed the dry, pithy root of a cottonwood. We smoked sections of this just like a cigar, and in our store the storekeeper had them for sale. We used to take only a few puffs on them and throw them away. We also dried the leaves of¬†tc'√≠≈Çt'√≤j√©`¬†[‚Äúone sucks it‚Äù (sour dock)] and kept them in a little sack. We rolled cigarettes with these, using the paper from sugar or coffee packages which we picked up at home. Our families did not scold us for doing this. We didn't make ropes to play with. The girls used to make dolls. Little girls made dolls by bundling old rags together and tying them around the middle. Sometimes they made the hair of shredded cloth. We didn't paint our faces, but we used to tattoo marks on our skin‚Äîjust marks, not letters. We put them on our wrists, hands, and faces.


[Page 490]


Sometimes we played at having a social dance. We made a little drum out of a tin can. We put some water inside and stretched a piece of cloth across the mouth, tying it there. There would be a whole crowd of children, just like big people gathered at a dance. The boys would sing and sometimes the little girls would sing also. We sang old CJ37's songs, his lightning songs.¬†26¬†


Some of the little boys would tell the little girls to go out and start dancing. They would, several of them dancing back and forth together to the music. Then the boys would tell them to dance¬†≈Ç√†d√†tc'√¨tc'√πc¬†[a type of social dance], and the little girls would pick partners from among the boys to dance with them. Most of these children were from six to eight years old. Older children didn't take part in it. We danced in the daytime, right beside our own homes.


We never played at having a puberty ceremony for a girl, at holding curing ceremonies for sick people, at giving a hunting ceremony, or at singing deer, snake, or other such sacred songs. But we did play at giving the¬†g√°Àôn¬†dance and social dances. One boy called¬†nd√®Àôz√©`¬†[‚Äútall one‚Äù] was the leader in our community in any play of this sort. I guess he did not wish to play at curing rites or hunting ceremonies, or we might have done it. As he took the initiative in such things, we merely followed him. He was about sixteen at the time all this happened, and I must have been around ten. Some of the other boys were big boys, fourteen and fifteen years old.¬†nd√®Àôz√©`¬†is still living at Fort Apache. He used to pretend he was the father of John Roberson [a famous¬†g√°Àôn¬†shaman at that time] and knew all the¬†g√°Àôn¬†power. He made small¬†g√°Àôn¬†masks for us to wear from the left-over pieces when the men made real¬†g√°Àôn¬†masks for a ceremony. They were of the sotol stalk. We gave these¬†g√°Àôn¬†dances at night. We didn't even pretend to be curing anyone, but just gave them to have the dance.¬†nd√®Àôz√©`¬†himself painted the boys who were going to dance as¬†g√°Àôn.¬†When John Roberson's father used to paint his own dancers, at the end he put a dot of white paint on each of his cheeks and then ran the ends of his fingers dipped in white paint down the backs of his hands in a zigzag. So this boy used to do the same thing. Then he walked out to where we had the fire and called out¬†h√†g√∫Àô, h√†g√∫Àô,¬†just as John Roberson's father did. This was a signal for the impersonators to make their entry.


We used to hold this dance not far from our own homes.¬†nd√®Àôz√©`¬†sang for us. He sang real¬†g√°Àôn¬†songs, ones belonging to this same¬†g√°Àôn¬†shaman which he had picked up from hearing him sing them. He used to have a regular-sized drum made from a large can. He always brought it out when we had a dance. I don't know where he kept it. After the¬†g√°Àôn¬†dance was finished, we would have the circle dance.¬†27¬†


After the¬†[Page 491]¬†circle dance, we danced¬†≈Ç√®d√†tc'√¨tc'√πc.¬†Sometimes it used to turn into a real big dance, older youths and maidens coming down and joining in, helping to carry it through. We younger boys and girls would social dance also. Little girls walked up to a boy and touched him on the shoulder, inviting him to dance, just like grownups. But when only we younger children were playing at it, the dance petered out after a while. We would get tired of it. For the social dancing,¬†nd√®Àôz√©`¬†and some of the rest of us boys sang lightning songs, ones that belonged to the old man, CJ37. He knew we used them, but he didn't seem to mind. When the dance was finished, we put the¬†g√°Àôn¬†masks away in the brush for the night. The next morning we would conceal them where no one could find them, just as a real¬†g√°Àôn¬†shaman would do with his masks. Grownups didn't come to watch these dances of ours. They didn't seem to bother particularly about them, though sometimes our parents would tell us not to do it any more. But you know how kids are. They don't always obey their parents. We kept it up.


John Roberson's father used to give his¬†g√°Àôn¬†dance at almost every girl's puberty ceremony. After the ceremony he put the masks away in a cave across the river, not so far from where we lived. Other shamans who had ceremonial articles to be put away used the same cave. There was a great deal of ceremonial material in this cave.¬†28¬†


Sometimes when just we boys were off in the hills during the daytime, without any girls, we would go to this cave, take the masks out, put them on, and pretend to dance. This was under the leadership of¬†nd√®Àôz√©`.¬†But we never touched the hoops or crosses of the lightning shamans which were there. We were afraid of them.¬†29¬†


We fooled around with the masks for an hour or so and then put them back and went on our way.¬†30¬†





One time, I and some other boys went past this cave.¬†nd√®Àôz√©`,¬†who was with us, said, ‚ÄúCome on, let's have a dance.‚Äù We got the masks out, and he put them on us and painted us all up. We made dancing kilts by wrapping our shirts about our waists. Then he told us to wait there, that he was going off a little way, and, when he gave the call and started to sing, to come out and dance. We stood there, waiting. We waited and waited, but he did not call. Finally he took off the masks and went to see what was the matter. He was not there. He had played a joke and run off and left us. Not long after this, John Roberson's father must have found out what we boys had been doing. He must have dreamed about it, for he said, ‚ÄúSome boy is doing the same way I do.‚Äù He meant that someone had been using his masks.¬†[Page 492]¬†He was angry. But he didn't mind us children making our own small masks and putting on dances at home in which we used his songs. Later on, when¬†nd√®Àôz√©`¬†grew up, this same¬†g√°Àôn¬†shaman used him as a real¬†g√°Àôn¬†dancer. He was a very good one and danced many times, but he never became a¬†g√°Àôn¬†shaman.


There are no children's songs. The only songs that children sing are ones they hear grownups sing. I first started to sing when I was about six or seven. I sang a few songs such as the lightning songs of CJ37, but I only knew parts, not the whole song. I also was able to sing snatches of love songs that I had heard, but I couldn't sing any social dance songs. They were too hard. All of us kids would try to sing parts of such songs as these, but it wasn't until I was about ten that I first really started to learn whole songs. Old CJ37 often sang all night at curing or other ceremonies. He sang lightning songs and medicine songs, as well as others. We boys weren't meant to attend these ceremonies, but we did. The first song I learned to sing was a lightning song. We used to go to the curing ceremonies of CJ13, another shaman. He had all kinds of power for curing sicknesses: snake power, bear power, and others. From hearing these songs sung, we boys learned them. We could not sing the words, but we could sing the choruses. We used to try out one song at our play dances and sing it over and over again until we finally learned it. Then we would learn another and start using it.


We did not play at death and burial. We never did. I don't think it was because we were afraid of it. It was mainly because we never thought about playing that way. Besides, we didn't have the amount of sickness and death then that we have had since.


By the time I was old enough to join in the boys' war game [after eleven or twelve], boys had ceased playing it. But when I was a small boy, not yet old enough to join in, I can remember older boys playing it. Down at Dewey Flats, the Eastern White Mountain camps were on one side of the river, the Western White Mountain camps on the other. The boys from each side played this game against one another. They fought with slings and stones. The Yavapai, camped on the river below us, fought the Arivaipa boys near them in the same way. Big boys and sometimes men took part. Once I was swimming in the river with another small boy. We had no clothes on. A Yavapai youth came along and slung a stone at us. We got up and ran. We tried to throw rocks at him, but missed. We escaped into some thick brush and lay there. He could not see us but slung a stone blindly into the thicket. It hit me right on the buttocks. Years later I met this Yavapai as a man. We talked about that time and laughed.


When I was a boy of ten or so, I used to pretend to play at ‚Äúhidden-ball‚Äù with other boys my age. We didn't play with moccasins but hid¬†[Page 493]¬†the ball in the ground. We learned this game from the San Carlos people. We used to go and watch grown men playing it, for they played it not far from the camps. That's how we learned it. After watching a game among the men, boys were likely to start one of their own the next day. We played either during the day or at night, sometimes inside the wickiup. But we just played a little while and then quit. We would bet arrows and marbles with each other. Little girls came and watched us, just like women do at a real game, but they never played. When I was older, I and other boys my age played at hoop-and-poles. But until boys were about fifteen years old they never played this game. It was a man's game. I can remember when I and two friends of mine played it. We had a set of poles made of batamota, and our hoop was of mesquite root. Sometimes, boys made their hoop-and-poles of willow. A boy who owned a set always took it home with him at night after the game, just as a man would do. We had lots of fun playing at this game. There would be a whole lot of boys, just as there were many men about a hoop-and-poles course when they played. We knew exactly how to play it, and our hoops had ‚Äúbig bead‚Äù in the middle, with fifty beads, sometimes sixty-one beads, on each side.¬†31¬†


We gambled, betting our marbles and tops, but we never pretended to have gambling power for this game. We didn't know about that. Boys weren't allowed to use a real set of hoop-and-poles for fear they would damage them. Just as no women or girls were allowed around when men played hoop-and-poles, we boys didn't let any girls come where we were playing.


Up to ten years old or so boys and girls very often played together, but after eleven or twelve they separated. The sort of play I have told you about [all the preceding, excluding the hoop-and-poles game, the play with the real¬†g√°Àôn¬†masks, and the boy's war game] was mainly girls and boys together. Boys alone didn't play at family, marriage, cooking, making wickiups, or rations. After a boy was eleven or twelve, he spent most of his time going about in groups with other boys, hunting birds and small animals, sometimes all day and even at night, or playing certain boy's games which I will tell you about. Girls played separately from big boys after this age also. Many girls played until they were fifteen or so. They made wickiups just as we did when younger, but these were larger and better made, about six feet high. Inside they played at household with little children, both boys and girls, though these little kids were just there mainly to watch them. That's the way small children learn to play. The big girls would play at cooking. They didn't pretend mud was their food, the way small children do, but they boiled water, pretending it was tulibai and such things. They used to¬†[Page [facing p.494]]


PLATE VIII


PLAYING AT COOKING


[Page 494]¬†make dolls, really good ones, and clothe them in girl's dresses which they sewed. They made the hair of real hair so that it hung down the back. They made miniature moccasins of buckskin for them. They knew how to make good dolls.


We big boys used to hunt kangaroo rats out in the brush at night-time. We didn't eat them. We just killed them. One time a bunch of us boys went across the river from Dewey Flats and killed a whole sackful. There was an old woman living near by who was so old that she was in her second childhood. She spent most of her time asleep. That night we crept into her wickiup and put the sack of rats at the side of her bed as she slept. She slept with the kangaroo rats all night, not knowing it. Next morning I guess she was mad when she found out. Sometimes we boys hunted quail at night. We crossed back and forth across the Gila River as many as two and three times in a night doing this, even in wintertime. I and one of my cross-cousins were out like this one night. We thought we saw a duck in the river. We shot at it. It was just an old stick. We lost our arrow and so we built a fire and made another one by its light. At other times we went up toward Turn-bull Mountain, where there were many cactus plants growing. The quail roosted on these, and we killed them. Sometimes three or four of us would ride burros out into the hills to shoot doves during their nesting season. They were easy to hit when they sat on the nest. When we went out in the hills to hunt, the oldest boy was always the leader. We went where he said. When we killed birds, sometimes we would stop and cook and eat them.


We used to play at renegades and soldiers. CJ30 played with us. He was a lot older than the rest of us. He always used to take the part of Apache Kid, and one other boy always took the part of a Chiricahua renegade. The rest of us were soldiers and scouts and would try to capture these two. There were two hills where we usually played this game. The renegades would come out on the side of one hill and holler at us. Then they would come out on the other side of the hill and shout. We used horse manure as bullets. If you got hit by one of these bullets, you were dead right there. For our captain we had one lame boy. There were boys older than he who could have been captain, but we made him captain because he could not travel fast and was always in the rear.¬†32¬†





We always played this game at night. One evening when we were playing we saw a man coming riding toward us. We could see the glint of his rifle barrel in the moonlight. It was only the older brother of Elton Causey coming home from a party, but, thinking it was really Apache Kid, we got scared and all ran off. Our captain was left behind. He hollered at us. Later, the same evening, the oldest¬†[Page [facing p. 495]]


PLATE IX


CHILDREN AT PLAY


[Page 495]¬†boys among us went up to where some white men, freighting with wagons, had camped for the night. They crept into the camp and stole some biscuits out of a dutch oven. They took a can of salt too. They brought this back to where the rest of us were waiting. We split the biscuits up between us, put salt on them, and ate them. Each one of us got one. This was to feed us soldiers. The white men must have been very sound asleep. The next morning a white man from the camp climbed up on top of a hill where he could overlook our camps. He thought we had taken the biscuits, but he didn't say anything.


One time I, Charley Sago,¬†nd√®Àôz√©`,¬†and some other boys went down river to where the Yavapai were living. We hung about all day. We saw that the Yavapai had a lot of good melons in their fields. We waited until night and then went into the fields and ate our fill of them. We gathered more melons and took them up to where some Mexican freighters were camped on the road. They gave us a meal and some sugar and coffee in exchange for the melons. We left, and after we had gone a little way we could hear the Mexicans commence to shout. We thought that the Yavapai must have found the Mexicans with their melons and that they would soon be on our trail. We ran for it. After a while we heard someone coming on horseback, so we split up. It was too dark to see. When the rider was close, one of the boys hollered, ‚ÄúHello.‚Äù The man answered ‚ÄúHello‚Äù and went on. After going a way farther, we stopped and built a fire to warm ourselves. From there we went to our homes. When I got home, I found mother telling stories with an old woman. That's the way old women used to do. They had cooked up some corn and were eating it. I had some of the coffee and sugar tied in the corner of my shirt. Mother asked me where I got it, and I told her that the Mexicans had given it to me. But I really got it for the melons I had stolen.


I can't remember the children that I played with before I was ten, but from then on, until I went off to school at fourteen, my two best friends were Paul Nosey and Elton Causey. The first died in school.¬†33¬†


The second didn't go to school at the same time I did, but not long after that mother told me he went to our camp and lay down on my bed and told her, ‚ÄúWell, I guess I'll go to school also.‚Äù He didn't have to go, but he wanted to be with me. The first I knew of it, I saw him there at the school, with his hair already cut like a schoolboy. All three of us were of the same band. We always went about together. Paul was my cross-cousin by clan because his clan was related to that of my father. He was also the son of my mother's half-sister's son. Because of this, our families always camped close together, and that is how I got to know him so well. Elton was of the same clan as Paul and so was also¬†[Page 496]¬†my cross-cousin. Whenever we traveled, Elton and his mother used to accompany us, as she was a great friend of my mother's.


Another boy whom I went about with a great deal was the younger brother of Henry Hudson. He was of my father's clan [also a cross-cousin]. There was a boy named Calvin I used to see a lot of. His father's clan and my father's clan were the same, so we were parallel cousins, but I didn't know he was my brother in this way until very much later.¬†nd√®Àôz√©`,¬†the boy who used to be the leader of the¬†g√°Àôn¬†dances, was also a parallel cousin of mine for the same reason. This I did not know until we had grown up. There were other boys we saw, but I saw most of the first four above. There must have been about twenty-five of us boys who played around together. We were of varying ages. We didn't always play together, but often split up to play in small groups because some would want to go one way, some another. Some days there wasn't anything doing at all, and at other times fathers wouldn't let their boys go off to play because they had work for them to do, such as going after the horses. But whenever we played at games such as scouts and renegades, or held a dance, all of us would be there.


24In connection with a child's knowledge of social practices, Neil Buck once remarked, ‚ÄúAs a small boy I heard older people use the expression which signifies that a widow has been reclaimed in marriage by some kinsman of her dead husband. I used to wonder what it meant, and it was several years before I found out.‚Äù

The material represents the period from 1893 to 1903. This, of course, was twenty years after the establishment of the San Carlos Reservation, when reservation life had settled into a groove of its own:


We children used to go to the edge of the river where the willows grew. There we made play wickiups of the willows and pretended to live as older people do. Boys and girls used to get married. Although we didn't exchange gifts such as horses at these marriages, we exchanged food and drink. The boy's family would prepare tulibai. There would be twenty-five mounds of earth piled up in a line, each representing one can of tulibai. The man whose daughter was to be married was invited to bring his family over to drink them. As each can was finished, the mound of earth was obliterated. A little later, the girl's family would prepare a great feast and invite the boy's family over. They had round¬†[Page 487]¬†flat pieces of limestone for the dishes and on each would be a different kind of make-believe food. When we got there, they would point out each kind to us, saying, ‚ÄúThis is walnuts; this is acorn meal and stewed meat.‚Äù


When a boy married, he never married his own sister. We knew about that. But we never thought about clan exogamy, and it didn't matter to us whether two children married who were of the same clan. We didn't pretend that they were of different clans. Also, we boys didn't avoid our own blood sisters, nor they us. We were too young for that. We didn't even pretend to avoid them. We began to think about that much later. We didn't joke our real cross-cousins then, either. We were too young.¬†24¬†


24In connection with a child's knowledge of social practices, Neil Buck once remarked, ‚ÄúAs a small boy I heard older people use the expression which signifies that a widow has been reclaimed in marriage by some kinsman of her dead husband. I used to wonder what it meant, and it was several years before I found out.‚Äù


A boy had to respect his parents-in-law and avoid his mother-in-law, so his camp was built at a little distance from that of his wife's parents. Though we called each other by our regular names in play when we wanted to, a man couldn't call the names of his parents-in-law, just as it is with grownups. He called them¬†c√†Àôd√†Àôn√≠`¬†[proper affinal term]. We had brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law whom we called¬†c√¨Œ≥√≠Àô¬†[proper affinal term] as well. We used to pretend that a man had obligations to his father-in-law. We had a play store, and he would have to go to the store all the time to buy things for his father-in-law. When we played family, we pretended we had children, but we never pretended that a woman was pregnant or that she gave birth to a baby. We didn't play that the youngest child was the favorite either, as it is among grownups.


I can remember one time when I was a small kid and we were playing family. One girl of the¬†n√°Œ≥√≤d√®sg√¨jn¬†clan was my mother. There were a lot of other small boys there. We made three or four little piles of dirt, calling them cans of tulibai. When we finished one can, we leveled the pile. Soon we all said we were drunk. I was my mother's only child, so I was alone. The other boys pretended to start a fight with me. They all jumped on me. The girl who was my mother hollered at the top of her lungs as a grown person would do, ‚ÄúThe¬†'√¨y√†`'√°iy‚ñ°¬†[clan] boys are fighting my son.‚Äù She shouted so loud that my real mother and older sister back at camp heard her. They used to laugh afterward when they told about it. But we didn't play at having clan blood-feuds. Maybe some children did, but then, you know, not all children play in the same way.


When we played at family and camp life, we did not pretend that one of us was chief and that others were wealthy, influential men, but we¬†[Page 488]¬†used to have police. When a man had tulibai, these police sometimes came around and caught him. Then the policeman would dump out the tulibai and arrest the man. The tulibai was muddy water. We had a place we pretended was the guardhouse, and the man would be put in there for three or four days. At this guardhouse food was given to the prisoners. We played at issuing rations also, just as they really did at the agency. The rations were issued to us by our police at the guardhouse. We used to ride to the guardhouse on willow sticks, which we said were horses, to receive our rations. The children would all line up in front of the guardhouse to get their rations. One policeman was detailed to watch the line and prevent any trouble which might arise, just as they really did at the agency, and a second issued the rations to us. We did not play school.


We didn't play at having cattle or burros or dogs, but we did play at horses. One boy would be sent out to drive the horses into camp. He would come in, bringing an armful of willow branches. These were the horses. Ration time would be coming round, so we would need the horses to ride in on to get rations. Men and their wives started off riding. If we had to stop on the way for the night, we tied our horses to a tree. Then we would pull up a few handfuls of grass and leave them there for the horse to eat, just as we had seen our elders do.


We boys also used to make wagons out of tin cans. That was before the railroad came through, and we used to see many teams go by on the way to San Carlos and Globe, hauling freight. They would camp along the road and leave tin cans. We made the wagons of these tin cans. We put the can in a fire and heated it until the solder at both ends melted, and the two round ends came loose. These we made into wheels, punching a hole through the centers for the axle. The rest of the tin we flattened out straight. Then we bent each edge down on the long sides. We punched other holes in the bent-down edges, so we could run sticks through for the axles and attach the wheels. We put two wheels in front and only one in back. Through the sides of the wagon bottom we struck upright poles to hold the loads on, just like a real wagon. Almost every boy had one of these. We used to pretend to haul loads of wood on them, lengths of greasewood about seven inches long. We hauled them to the store to sell to the storekeeper. Sometimes we boys played with the wagons by ourselves without girls, pretending that we were freighting. One boy would go ahead, the others following in a long line along the road, just as we had seen freighters go by. We were hauling to the store. When we played at home where the dogs were, we used to make believe they were horses, and pack loads on them. But the dogs would not follow us away from camp, so we had to use willow branches for horses elsewhere.


After we had been playing family and camps down by the river a¬†[Page 489]¬†while, one of the older boys would say he was going to be a white man and run a store. He would make a little inclosure by setting sticks up in the ground. This was the store. Inside, he used sticks to make a sort of shelf to put his goods on. He made things out of mud. These, and stones, were the store goods. The store was always about two hundred yards distant from our camps. When we went to the store to buy things, we used small stones for money. We didn't have any charge accounts.¬†25


25¬†Notice that the store is at a distance from the camp, just as it should be. Charge accounts are now the most common way of doing business, although they were less common in former times.


We never played at hunting large game such as deer, but all boys had bows and arrows and used to go out hunting small game. We really did it; we didn't play at it. We did not play at having farms and raising crops,





at going out to gather wild seeds and acorns, or at cooking mescal. That was the old way, but we had our store to buy food in. Girls used to cook mud in cans on a fire. That was our food. When we made a fire, we made a very small one because our play wickiups were small. A few boys had those small, old-fashioned matches, but the rest of us had to get our fire at home and carry it down to where we played.


Older boys made knives out of tin cans. Only boys, not girls, did this. The knife was made by bending a piece of tin about the end of a stick, so that it stayed in place. One end of the stick served as a handle. The blade was curved and ground to an edge. The older boys who had these knives always carried them in their pockets, so that if they were out hunting and broke an arrow they could fashion another. They always had a pocketful of all kinds of birds' feathers, as well as sinew, so that they could repair or make new arrows at any time.


Boys, not girls, used to pretend to smoke. We would go along the riverbanks where the water had exposed the dry, pithy root of a cottonwood. We smoked sections of this just like a cigar, and in our store the storekeeper had them for sale. We used to take only a few puffs on them and throw them away. We also dried the leaves of¬†tc'√≠≈Çt'√≤j√©`¬†[‚Äúone sucks it‚Äù (sour dock)] and kept them in a little sack. We rolled cigarettes with these, using the paper from sugar or coffee packages which we picked up at home. Our families did not scold us for doing this. We didn't make ropes to play with. The girls used to make dolls. Little girls made dolls by bundling old rags together and tying them around the middle. Sometimes they made the hair of shredded cloth. We didn't paint our faces, but we used to tattoo marks on our skin‚Äîjust marks, not letters. We put them on our wrists, hands, and faces.


[Page 490]


Sometimes we played at having a social dance. We made a little drum out of a tin can. We put some water inside and stretched a piece of cloth across the mouth, tying it there. There would be a whole crowd of children, just like big people gathered at a dance. The boys would sing and sometimes the little girls would sing also. We sang old CJ37's songs, his lightning songs.¬†26¬†


26¬†CJ37 was a very powerful lightning shaman in the community.


Some of the little boys would tell the little girls to go out and start dancing. They would, several of them dancing back and forth together to the music. Then the boys would tell them to dance¬†≈Ç√†d√†tc'√¨tc'√πc¬†[a type of social dance], and the little girls would pick partners from among the boys to dance with them. Most of these children were from six to eight years old. Older children didn't take part in it. We danced in the daytime, right beside our own homes.


We never played at having a puberty ceremony for a girl, at holding curing ceremonies for sick people, at giving a hunting ceremony, or at singing deer, snake, or other such sacred songs. But we did play at giving the¬†g√°Àôn¬†dance and social dances. One boy called¬†nd√®Àôz√©`¬†[‚Äútall one‚Äù] was the leader in our community in any play of this sort. I guess he did not wish to play at curing rites or hunting ceremonies, or we might have done it. As he took the initiative in such things, we merely followed him. He was about sixteen at the time all this happened, and I must have been around ten. Some of the other boys were big boys, fourteen and fifteen years old.¬†nd√®Àôz√©`¬†is still living at Fort Apache. He used to pretend he was the father of John Roberson [a famous¬†g√°Àôn¬†shaman at that time] and knew all the¬†g√°Àôn¬†power. He made small¬†g√°Àôn¬†masks for us to wear from the left-over pieces when the men made real¬†g√°Àôn¬†masks for a ceremony. They were of the sotol stalk. We gave these¬†g√°Àôn¬†dances at night. We didn't even pretend to be curing anyone, but just gave them to have the dance.¬†nd√®Àôz√©`¬†himself painted the boys who were going to dance as¬†g√°Àôn.¬†When John Roberson's father used to paint his own dancers, at the end he put a dot of white paint on each of his cheeks and then ran the ends of his fingers dipped in white paint down the backs of his hands in a zigzag. So this boy used to do the same thing. Then he walked out to where we had the fire and called out¬†h√†g√∫Àô, h√†g√∫Àô,¬†just as John Roberson's father did. This was a signal for the impersonators to make their entry.


We used to hold this dance not far from our own homes.¬†nd√®Àôz√©`¬†sang for us. He sang real¬†g√°Àôn¬†songs, ones belonging to this same¬†g√°Àôn¬†shaman which he had picked up from hearing him sing them. He used to have a regular-sized drum made from a large can. He always brought it out when we had a dance. I don't know where he kept it. After the¬†g√°Àôn¬†dance was finished, we would have the circle dance.¬†27¬†


27¬†This customarily follows the completion of the¬†g√°Àôn¬†dance.


After the¬†[Page 491]¬†circle dance, we danced¬†≈Ç√®d√†tc'√¨tc'√πc.¬†Sometimes it used to turn into a real big dance, older youths and maidens coming down and joining in, helping to carry it through. We younger boys and girls would social dance also. Little girls walked up to a boy and touched him on the shoulder, inviting him to dance, just like grownups. But when only we younger children were playing at it, the dance petered out after a while. We would get tired of it. For the social dancing,¬†nd√®Àôz√©`¬†and some of the rest of us boys sang lightning songs, ones that belonged to the old man, CJ37. He knew we used them, but he didn't seem to mind. When the dance was finished, we put the¬†g√°Àôn¬†masks away in the brush for the night. The next morning we would conceal them where no one could find them, just as a real¬†g√°Àôn¬†shaman would do with his masks. Grownups didn't come to watch these dances of ours. They didn't seem to bother particularly about them, though sometimes our parents would tell us not to do it any more. But you know how kids are. They don't always obey their parents. We kept it up.


John Roberson's father used to give his¬†g√°Àôn¬†dance at almost every girl's puberty ceremony. After the ceremony he put the masks away in a cave across the river, not so far from where we lived. Other shamans who had ceremonial articles to be put away used the same cave. There was a great deal of ceremonial material in this cave.¬†28¬†


28¬†Such ceremonial objects, once put away, are never used again. It would be very dangerous to disturb them.


Sometimes when just we boys were off in the hills during the daytime, without any girls, we would go to this cave, take the masks out, put them on, and pretend to dance. This was under the leadership of¬†nd√®Àôz√©`.¬†But we never touched the hoops or crosses of the lightning shamans which were there. We were afraid of them.¬†29¬†


29¬†Lightning is the most dreaded of all supernatural forces.


We fooled around with the masks for an hour or so and then put them back and went on our way.¬†30¬†


30¬†The same thing was recorded for aboriginal times.


One time, I and some other boys went past this cave.¬†nd√®Àôz√©`,¬†who was with us, said, ‚ÄúCome on, let's have a dance.‚Äù We got the masks out, and he put them on us and painted us all up. We made dancing kilts by wrapping our shirts about our waists. Then he told us to wait there, that he was going off a little way, and, when he gave the call and started to sing, to come out and dance. We stood there, waiting. We waited and waited, but he did not call. Finally he took off the masks and went to see what was the matter. He was not there. He had played a joke and run off and left us. Not long after this, John Roberson's father must have found out what we boys had been doing. He must have dreamed about it, for he said, ‚ÄúSome boy is doing the same way I do.‚Äù He meant that someone had been using his masks.¬†[Page 492]¬†He was angry. But he didn't mind us children making our own small masks and putting on dances at home in which we used his songs. Later on, when¬†nd√®Àôz√©`¬†grew up, this same¬†g√°Àôn¬†shaman used him as a real¬†g√°Àôn¬†dancer. He was a very good one and danced many times, but he never became a¬†g√°Àôn¬†shaman.


There are no children's songs. The only songs that children sing are ones they hear grownups sing. I first started to sing when I was about six or seven. I sang a few songs such as the lightning songs of CJ37, but I only knew parts, not the whole song. I also was able to sing snatches of love songs that I had heard, but I couldn't sing any social dance songs. They were too hard. All of us kids would try to sing parts of such songs as these, but it wasn't until I was about ten that I first really started to learn whole songs. Old CJ37 often sang all night at curing or other ceremonies. He sang lightning songs and medicine songs, as well as others. We boys weren't meant to attend these ceremonies, but we did. The first song I learned to sing was a lightning song. We used to go to the curing ceremonies of CJ13, another shaman. He had all kinds of power for curing sicknesses: snake power, bear power, and others. From hearing these songs sung, we boys learned them. We could not sing the words, but we could sing the choruses. We used to try out one song at our play dances and sing it over and over again until we finally learned it. Then we would learn another and start using it.


We did not play at death and burial. We never did. I don't think it was because we were afraid of it. It was mainly because we never thought about playing that way. Besides, we didn't have the amount of sickness and death then that we have had since.


By the time I was old enough to join in the boys' war game [after eleven or twelve], boys had ceased playing it. But when I was a small boy, not yet old enough to join in, I can remember older boys playing it. Down at Dewey Flats, the Eastern White Mountain camps were on one side of the river, the Western White Mountain camps on the other. The boys from each side played this game against one another. They fought with slings and stones. The Yavapai, camped on the river below us, fought the Arivaipa boys near them in the same way. Big boys and sometimes men took part. Once I was swimming in the river with another small boy. We had no clothes on. A Yavapai youth came along and slung a stone at us. We got up and ran. We tried to throw rocks at him, but missed. We escaped into some thick brush and lay there. He could not see us but slung a stone blindly into the thicket. It hit me right on the buttocks. Years later I met this Yavapai as a man. We talked about that time and laughed.


When I was a boy of ten or so, I used to pretend to play at ‚Äúhidden-ball‚Äù with other boys my age. We didn't play with moccasins but hid¬†[Page 493]¬†the ball in the ground. We learned this game from the San Carlos people. We used to go and watch grown men playing it, for they played it not far from the camps. That's how we learned it. After watching a game among the men, boys were likely to start one of their own the next day. We played either during the day or at night, sometimes inside the wickiup. But we just played a little while and then quit. We would bet arrows and marbles with each other. Little girls came and watched us, just like women do at a real game, but they never played. When I was older, I and other boys my age played at hoop-and-poles. But until boys were about fifteen years old they never played this game. It was a man's game. I can remember when I and two friends of mine played it. We had a set of poles made of batamota, and our hoop was of mesquite root. Sometimes, boys made their hoop-and-poles of willow. A boy who owned a set always took it home with him at night after the game, just as a man would do. We had lots of fun playing at this game. There would be a whole lot of boys, just as there were many men about a hoop-and-poles course when they played. We knew exactly how to play it, and our hoops had ‚Äúbig bead‚Äù in the middle, with fifty beads, sometimes sixty-one beads, on each side.¬†31¬†


31¬†Beads are the coils about a cord tied across the diameter of the hoop. They are used in scoring.


We gambled, betting our marbles and tops, but we never pretended to have gambling power for this game. We didn't know about that. Boys weren't allowed to use a real set of hoop-and-poles for fear they would damage them. Just as no women or girls were allowed around when men played hoop-and-poles, we boys didn't let any girls come where we were playing.


Up to ten years old or so boys and girls very often played together, but after eleven or twelve they separated. The sort of play I have told you about [all the preceding, excluding the hoop-and-poles game, the play with the real¬†g√°Àôn¬†masks, and the boy's war game] was mainly girls and boys together. Boys alone didn't play at family, marriage, cooking, making wickiups, or rations. After a boy was eleven or twelve, he spent most of his time going about in groups with other boys, hunting birds and small animals, sometimes all day and even at night, or playing certain boy's games which I will tell you about. Girls played separately from big boys after this age also. Many girls played until they were fifteen or so. They made wickiups just as we did when younger, but these were larger and better made, about six feet high. Inside they played at household with little children, both boys and girls, though these little kids were just there mainly to watch them. That's the way small children learn to play. The big girls would play at cooking. They didn't pretend mud was their food, the way small children do, but they boiled water, pretending it was tulibai and such things. They used to¬†[Page [facing p.494]]





[Page 494]¬†make dolls, really good ones, and clothe them in girl's dresses which they sewed. They made the hair of real hair so that it hung down the back. They made miniature moccasins of buckskin for them. They knew how to make good dolls.


We big boys used to hunt kangaroo rats out in the brush at night-time. We didn't eat them. We just killed them. One time a bunch of us boys went across the river from Dewey Flats and killed a whole sackful. There was an old woman living near by who was so old that she was in her second childhood. She spent most of her time asleep. That night we crept into her wickiup and put the sack of rats at the side of her bed as she slept. She slept with the kangaroo rats all night, not knowing it. Next morning I guess she was mad when she found out. Sometimes we boys hunted quail at night. We crossed back and forth across the Gila River as many as two and three times in a night doing this, even in wintertime. I and one of my cross-cousins were out like this one night. We thought we saw a duck in the river. We shot at it. It was just an old stick. We lost our arrow and so we built a fire and made another one by its light. At other times we went up toward Turn-bull Mountain, where there were many cactus plants growing. The quail roosted on these, and we killed them. Sometimes three or four of us would ride burros out into the hills to shoot doves during their nesting season. They were easy to hit when they sat on the nest. When we went out in the hills to hunt, the oldest boy was always the leader. We went where he said. When we killed birds, sometimes we would stop and cook and eat them.


We used to play at renegades and soldiers. CJ30 played with us. He was a lot older than the rest of us. He always used to take the part of Apache Kid, and one other boy always took the part of a Chiricahua renegade. The rest of us were soldiers and scouts and would try to capture these two. There were two hills where we usually played this game. The renegades would come out on the side of one hill and holler at us. Then they would come out on the other side of the hill and shout. We used horse manure as bullets. If you got hit by one of these bullets, you were dead right there. For our captain we had one lame boy. There were boys older than he who could have been captain, but we made him captain because he could not travel fast and was always in the rear.¬†32¬†


32¬†Old scouts often speak of how their white officers were unable to keep up with them on foot during campaigns against hostile Apache.


We always played this game at night. One evening when we were playing we saw a man coming riding toward us. We could see the glint of his rifle barrel in the moonlight. It was only the older brother of Elton Causey coming home from a party, but, thinking it was really Apache Kid, we got scared and all ran off. Our captain was left behind. He hollered at us. Later, the same evening, the oldest¬†[Page [facing p. 495]]





[Page 495]¬†boys among us went up to where some white men, freighting with wagons, had camped for the night. They crept into the camp and stole some biscuits out of a dutch oven. They took a can of salt too. They brought this back to where the rest of us were waiting. We split the biscuits up between us, put salt on them, and ate them. Each one of us got one. This was to feed us soldiers. The white men must have been very sound asleep. The next morning a white man from the camp climbed up on top of a hill where he could overlook our camps. He thought we had taken the biscuits, but he didn't say anything.


One time I, Charley Sago,¬†nd√®Àôz√©`,¬†and some other boys went down river to where the Yavapai were living. We hung about all day. We saw that the Yavapai had a lot of good melons in their fields. We waited until night and then went into the fields and ate our fill of them. We gathered more melons and took them up to where some Mexican freighters were camped on the road. They gave us a meal and some sugar and coffee in exchange for the melons. We left, and after we had gone a little way we could hear the Mexicans commence to shout. We thought that the Yavapai must have found the Mexicans with their melons and that they would soon be on our trail. We ran for it. After a while we heard someone coming on horseback, so we split up. It was too dark to see. When the rider was close, one of the boys hollered, ‚ÄúHello.‚Äù The man answered ‚ÄúHello‚Äù and went on. After going a way farther, we stopped and built a fire to warm ourselves. From there we went to our homes. When I got home, I found mother telling stories with an old woman. That's the way old women used to do. They had cooked up some corn and were eating it. I had some of the coffee and sugar tied in the corner of my shirt. Mother asked me where I got it, and I told her that the Mexicans had given it to me. But I really got it for the melons I had stolen.


I can't remember the children that I played with before I was ten, but from then on, until I went off to school at fourteen, my two best friends were Paul Nosey and Elton Causey. The first died in school.¬†33¬†


33¬†The second boy mentioned was not a close friend of the narrator's in adult life.


The second didn't go to school at the same time I did, but not long after that mother told me he went to our camp and lay down on my bed and told her, ‚ÄúWell, I guess I'll go to school also.‚Äù He didn't have to go, but he wanted to be with me. The first I knew of it, I saw him there at the school, with his hair already cut like a schoolboy. All three of us were of the same band. We always went about together. Paul was my cross-cousin by clan because his clan was related to that of my father. He was also the son of my mother's half-sister's son. Because of this, our families always camped close together, and that is how I got to know him so well. Elton was of the same clan as Paul and so was also¬†[Page 496]¬†my cross-cousin. Whenever we traveled, Elton and his mother used to accompany us, as she was a great friend of my mother's.


Another boy whom I went about with a great deal was the younger brother of Henry Hudson. He was of my father's clan [also a cross-cousin]. There was a boy named Calvin I used to see a lot of. His father's clan and my father's clan were the same, so we were parallel cousins, but I didn't know he was my brother in this way until very much later.¬†nd√®Àôz√©`,¬†the boy who used to be the leader of the¬†g√°Àôn¬†dances, was also a parallel cousin of mine for the same reason. This I did not know until we had grown up. There were other boys we saw, but I saw most of the first four above. There must have been about twenty-five of us boys who played around together. We were of varying ages. We didn't always play together, but often split up to play in small groups because some would want to go one way, some another. Some days there wasn't anything doing at all, and at other times fathers wouldn't let their boys go off to play because they had work for them to do, such as going after the horses. But whenever we played at games such as scouts and renegades, or held a dance, all of us would be there.",NA,NA,https://ehrafworldcultures.yale.edu/sres/852d509b-4a16-4a8a-a3be-f480df52ad3f,33.86,-110.12,1942,5580,Use,Single

The material represents the period from 1893 to 1903. This, of course, was twenty years after the establishment of the San Carlos Reservation, when reservation life had settled into a groove of its own:


We children used to go to the edge of the river where the willows grew. There we made play wickiups of the willows and pretended to live as older people do. Boys and girls used to get married. Although we didn't exchange gifts such as horses at these marriages, we exchanged food and drink. The boy's family would prepare tulibai. There would be twenty-five mounds of earth piled up in a line, each representing one can of tulibai. The man whose daughter was to be married was invited to bring his family over to drink them. As each can was finished, the mound of earth was obliterated. A little later, the girl's family would prepare a great feast and invite the boy's family over. They had round¬†[Page 487]¬†flat pieces of limestone for the dishes and on each would be a different kind of make-believe food. When we got there, they would point out each kind to us, saying, ‚ÄúThis is walnuts; this is acorn meal and stewed meat.‚Äù


When a boy married, he never married his own sister. We knew about that. But we never thought about clan exogamy, and it didn't matter to us whether two children married who were of the same clan. We didn't pretend that they were of different clans. Also, we boys didn't avoid our own blood sisters, nor they us. We were too young for that. We didn't even pretend to avoid them. We began to think about that much later. We didn't joke our real cross-cousins then, either. We were too young.¬†24¬†





A boy had to respect his parents-in-law and avoid his mother-in-law, so his camp was built at a little distance from that of his wife's parents. Though we called each other by our regular names in play when we wanted to, a man couldn't call the names of his parents-in-law, just as it is with grownups. He called them¬†c√†Àôd√†Àôn√≠`¬†[proper affinal term]. We had brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law whom we called¬†c√¨Œ≥√≠Àô¬†[proper affinal term] as well. We used to pretend that a man had obligations to his father-in-law. We had a play store, and he would have to go to the store all the time to buy things for his father-in-law. When we played family, we pretended we had children, but we never pretended that a woman was pregnant or that she gave birth to a baby. We didn't play that the youngest child was the favorite either, as it is among grownups.


I can remember one time when I was a small kid and we were playing family. One girl of the¬†n√°Œ≥√≤d√®sg√¨jn¬†clan was my mother. There were a lot of other small boys there. We made three or four little piles of dirt, calling them cans of tulibai. When we finished one can, we leveled the pile. Soon we all said we were drunk. I was my mother's only child, so I was alone. The other boys pretended to start a fight with me. They all jumped on me. The girl who was my mother hollered at the top of her lungs as a grown person would do, ‚ÄúThe¬†'√¨y√†`'√°iy‚ñ°¬†[clan] boys are fighting my son.‚Äù She shouted so loud that my real mother and older sister back at camp heard her. They used to laugh afterward when they told about it. But we didn't play at having clan blood-feuds. Maybe some children did, but then, you know, not all children play in the same way.





When we played at family and camp life, we did not pretend that one of us was chief and that others were wealthy, influential men, but we¬†[Page 488]¬†used to have police. When a man had tulibai, these police sometimes came around and caught him. Then the policeman would dump out the tulibai and arrest the man. The tulibai was muddy water. We had a place we pretended was the guardhouse, and the man would be put in there for three or four days. At this guardhouse food was given to the prisoners. We played at issuing rations also, just as they really did at the agency. The rations were issued to us by our police at the guardhouse. We used to ride to the guardhouse on willow sticks, which we said were horses, to receive our rations. The children would all line up in front of the guardhouse to get their rations. One policeman was detailed to watch the line and prevent any trouble which might arise, just as they really did at the agency, and a second issued the rations to us. We did not play school.


We didn't play at having cattle or burros or dogs, but we did play at horses. One boy would be sent out to drive the horses into camp. He would come in, bringing an armful of willow branches. These were the horses. Ration time would be coming round, so we would need the horses to ride in on to get rations. Men and their wives started off riding. If we had to stop on the way for the night, we tied our horses to a tree. Then we would pull up a few handfuls of grass and leave them there for the horse to eat, just as we had seen our elders do.


We boys also used to make wagons out of tin cans. That was before the railroad came through, and we used to see many teams go by on the way to San Carlos and Globe, hauling freight. They would camp along the road and leave tin cans. We made the wagons of these tin cans. We put the can in a fire and heated it until the solder at both ends melted, and the two round ends came loose. These we made into wheels, punching a hole through the centers for the axle. The rest of the tin we flattened out straight. Then we bent each edge down on the long sides. We punched other holes in the bent-down edges, so we could run sticks through for the axles and attach the wheels. We put two wheels in front and only one in back. Through the sides of the wagon bottom we struck upright poles to hold the loads on, just like a real wagon. Almost every boy had one of these. We used to pretend to haul loads of wood on them, lengths of greasewood about seven inches long. We hauled them to the store to sell to the storekeeper. Sometimes we boys played with the wagons by ourselves without girls, pretending that we were freighting. One boy would go ahead, the others following in a long line along the road, just as we had seen freighters go by. We were hauling to the store. When we played at home where the dogs were, we used to make believe they were horses, and pack loads on them. But the dogs would not follow us away from camp, so we had to use willow branches for horses elsewhere.


After we had been playing family and camps down by the river a¬†[Page 489]¬†while, one of the older boys would say he was going to be a white man and run a store. He would make a little inclosure by setting sticks up in the ground. This was the store. Inside, he used sticks to make a sort of shelf to put his goods on. He made things out of mud. These, and stones, were the store goods. The store was always about two hundred yards distant from our camps. When we went to the store to buy things, we used small stones for money. We didn't have any charge accounts.¬†25


We never played at hunting large game such as deer, but all boys had bows and arrows and used to go out hunting small game. We really did it; we didn't play at it. We did not play at having farms and raising crops,


BOY'S KNIFE


at going out to gather wild seeds and acorns, or at cooking mescal. That was the old way, but we had our store to buy food in. Girls used to cook mud in cans on a fire. That was our food. When we made a fire, we made a very small one because our play wickiups were small. A few boys had those small, old-fashioned matches, but the rest of us had to get our fire at home and carry it down to where we played.


Older boys made knives out of tin cans. Only boys, not girls, did this. The knife was made by bending a piece of tin about the end of a stick, so that it stayed in place. One end of the stick served as a handle. The blade was curved and ground to an edge. The older boys who had these knives always carried them in their pockets, so that if they were out hunting and broke an arrow they could fashion another. They always had a pocketful of all kinds of birds' feathers, as well as sinew, so that they could repair or make new arrows at any time.


Boys, not girls, used to pretend to smoke. We would go along the riverbanks where the water had exposed the dry, pithy root of a cottonwood. We smoked sections of this just like a cigar, and in our store the storekeeper had them for sale. We used to take only a few puffs on them and throw them away. We also dried the leaves of¬†tc'√≠≈Çt'√≤j√©`¬†[‚Äúone sucks it‚Äù (sour dock)] and kept them in a little sack. We rolled cigarettes with these, using the paper from sugar or coffee packages which we picked up at home. Our families did not scold us for doing this. We didn't make ropes to play with. The girls used to make dolls. Little girls made dolls by bundling old rags together and tying them around the middle. Sometimes they made the hair of shredded cloth. We didn't paint our faces, but we used to tattoo marks on our skin‚Äîjust marks, not letters. We put them on our wrists, hands, and faces.


[Page 490]


Sometimes we played at having a social dance. We made a little drum out of a tin can. We put some water inside and stretched a piece of cloth across the mouth, tying it there. There would be a whole crowd of children, just like big people gathered at a dance. The boys would sing and sometimes the little girls would sing also. We sang old CJ37's songs, his lightning songs.¬†26¬†


Some of the little boys would tell the little girls to go out and start dancing. They would, several of them dancing back and forth together to the music. Then the boys would tell them to dance¬†≈Ç√†d√†tc'√¨tc'√πc¬†[a type of social dance], and the little girls would pick partners from among the boys to dance with them. Most of these children were from six to eight years old. Older children didn't take part in it. We danced in the daytime, right beside our own homes.


We never played at having a puberty ceremony for a girl, at holding curing ceremonies for sick people, at giving a hunting ceremony, or at singing deer, snake, or other such sacred songs. But we did play at giving the¬†g√°Àôn¬†dance and social dances. One boy called¬†nd√®Àôz√©`¬†[‚Äútall one‚Äù] was the leader in our community in any play of this sort. I guess he did not wish to play at curing rites or hunting ceremonies, or we might have done it. As he took the initiative in such things, we merely followed him. He was about sixteen at the time all this happened, and I must have been around ten. Some of the other boys were big boys, fourteen and fifteen years old.¬†nd√®Àôz√©`¬†is still living at Fort Apache. He used to pretend he was the father of John Roberson [a famous¬†g√°Àôn¬†shaman at that time] and knew all the¬†g√°Àôn¬†power. He made small¬†g√°Àôn¬†masks for us to wear from the left-over pieces when the men made real¬†g√°Àôn¬†masks for a ceremony. They were of the sotol stalk. We gave these¬†g√°Àôn¬†dances at night. We didn't even pretend to be curing anyone, but just gave them to have the dance.¬†nd√®Àôz√©`¬†himself painted the boys who were going to dance as¬†g√°Àôn.¬†When John Roberson's father used to paint his own dancers, at the end he put a dot of white paint on each of his cheeks and then ran the ends of his fingers dipped in white paint down the backs of his hands in a zigzag. So this boy used to do the same thing. Then he walked out to where we had the fire and called out¬†h√†g√∫Àô, h√†g√∫Àô,¬†just as John Roberson's father did. This was a signal for the impersonators to make their entry.


We used to hold this dance not far from our own homes.¬†nd√®Àôz√©`¬†sang for us. He sang real¬†g√°Àôn¬†songs, ones belonging to this same¬†g√°Àôn¬†shaman which he had picked up from hearing him sing them. He used to have a regular-sized drum made from a large can. He always brought it out when we had a dance. I don't know where he kept it. After the¬†g√°Àôn¬†dance was finished, we would have the circle dance.¬†27¬†


After the¬†[Page 491]¬†circle dance, we danced¬†≈Ç√®d√†tc'√¨tc'√πc.¬†Sometimes it used to turn into a real big dance, older youths and maidens coming down and joining in, helping to carry it through. We younger boys and girls would social dance also. Little girls walked up to a boy and touched him on the shoulder, inviting him to dance, just like grownups. But when only we younger children were playing at it, the dance petered out after a while. We would get tired of it. For the social dancing,¬†nd√®Àôz√©`¬†and some of the rest of us boys sang lightning songs, ones that belonged to the old man, CJ37. He knew we used them, but he didn't seem to mind. When the dance was finished, we put the¬†g√°Àôn¬†masks away in the brush for the night. The next morning we would conceal them where no one could find them, just as a real¬†g√°Àôn¬†shaman would do with his masks. Grownups didn't come to watch these dances of ours. They didn't seem to bother particularly about them, though sometimes our parents would tell us not to do it any more. But you know how kids are. They don't always obey their parents. We kept it up.


John Roberson's father used to give his¬†g√°Àôn¬†dance at almost every girl's puberty ceremony. After the ceremony he put the masks away in a cave across the river, not so far from where we lived. Other shamans who had ceremonial articles to be put away used the same cave. There was a great deal of ceremonial material in this cave.¬†28¬†


Sometimes when just we boys were off in the hills during the daytime, without any girls, we would go to this cave, take the masks out, put them on, and pretend to dance. This was under the leadership of¬†nd√®Àôz√©`.¬†But we never touched the hoops or crosses of the lightning shamans which were there. We were afraid of them.¬†29¬†


We fooled around with the masks for an hour or so and then put them back and went on our way.¬†30¬†





One time, I and some other boys went past this cave.¬†nd√®Àôz√©`,¬†who was with us, said, ‚ÄúCome on, let's have a dance.‚Äù We got the masks out, and he put them on us and painted us all up. We made dancing kilts by wrapping our shirts about our waists. Then he told us to wait there, that he was going off a little way, and, when he gave the call and started to sing, to come out and dance. We stood there, waiting. We waited and waited, but he did not call. Finally he took off the masks and went to see what was the matter. He was not there. He had played a joke and run off and left us. Not long after this, John Roberson's father must have found out what we boys had been doing. He must have dreamed about it, for he said, ‚ÄúSome boy is doing the same way I do.‚Äù He meant that someone had been using his masks.¬†[Page 492]¬†He was angry. But he didn't mind us children making our own small masks and putting on dances at home in which we used his songs. Later on, when¬†nd√®Àôz√©`¬†grew up, this same¬†g√°Àôn¬†shaman used him as a real¬†g√°Àôn¬†dancer. He was a very good one and danced many times, but he never became a¬†g√°Àôn¬†shaman.


There are no children's songs. The only songs that children sing are ones they hear grownups sing. I first started to sing when I was about six or seven. I sang a few songs such as the lightning songs of CJ37, but I only knew parts, not the whole song. I also was able to sing snatches of love songs that I had heard, but I couldn't sing any social dance songs. They were too hard. All of us kids would try to sing parts of such songs as these, but it wasn't until I was about ten that I first really started to learn whole songs. Old CJ37 often sang all night at curing or other ceremonies. He sang lightning songs and medicine songs, as well as others. We boys weren't meant to attend these ceremonies, but we did. The first song I learned to sing was a lightning song. We used to go to the curing ceremonies of CJ13, another shaman. He had all kinds of power for curing sicknesses: snake power, bear power, and others. From hearing these songs sung, we boys learned them. We could not sing the words, but we could sing the choruses. We used to try out one song at our play dances and sing it over and over again until we finally learned it. Then we would learn another and start using it.


We did not play at death and burial. We never did. I don't think it was because we were afraid of it. It was mainly because we never thought about playing that way. Besides, we didn't have the amount of sickness and death then that we have had since.


By the time I was old enough to join in the boys' war game [after eleven or twelve], boys had ceased playing it. But when I was a small boy, not yet old enough to join in, I can remember older boys playing it. Down at Dewey Flats, the Eastern White Mountain camps were on one side of the river, the Western White Mountain camps on the other. The boys from each side played this game against one another. They fought with slings and stones. The Yavapai, camped on the river below us, fought the Arivaipa boys near them in the same way. Big boys and sometimes men took part. Once I was swimming in the river with another small boy. We had no clothes on. A Yavapai youth came along and slung a stone at us. We got up and ran. We tried to throw rocks at him, but missed. We escaped into some thick brush and lay there. He could not see us but slung a stone blindly into the thicket. It hit me right on the buttocks. Years later I met this Yavapai as a man. We talked about that time and laughed.


When I was a boy of ten or so, I used to pretend to play at ‚Äúhidden-ball‚Äù with other boys my age. We didn't play with moccasins but hid¬†[Page 493]¬†the ball in the ground. We learned this game from the San Carlos people. We used to go and watch grown men playing it, for they played it not far from the camps. That's how we learned it. After watching a game among the men, boys were likely to start one of their own the next day. We played either during the day or at night, sometimes inside the wickiup. But we just played a little while and then quit. We would bet arrows and marbles with each other. Little girls came and watched us, just like women do at a real game, but they never played. When I was older, I and other boys my age played at hoop-and-poles. But until boys were about fifteen years old they never played this game. It was a man's game. I can remember when I and two friends of mine played it. We had a set of poles made of batamota, and our hoop was of mesquite root. Sometimes, boys made their hoop-and-poles of willow. A boy who owned a set always took it home with him at night after the game, just as a man would do. We had lots of fun playing at this game. There would be a whole lot of boys, just as there were many men about a hoop-and-poles course when they played. We knew exactly how to play it, and our hoops had ‚Äúbig bead‚Äù in the middle, with fifty beads, sometimes sixty-one beads, on each side.¬†31¬†


We gambled, betting our marbles and tops, but we never pretended to have gambling power for this game. We didn't know about that. Boys weren't allowed to use a real set of hoop-and-poles for fear they would damage them. Just as no women or girls were allowed around when men played hoop-and-poles, we boys didn't let any girls come where we were playing.


Up to ten years old or so boys and girls very often played together, but after eleven or twelve they separated. The sort of play I have told you about [all the preceding, excluding the hoop-and-poles game, the play with the real¬†g√°Àôn¬†masks, and the boy's war game] was mainly girls and boys together. Boys alone didn't play at family, marriage, cooking, making wickiups, or rations. After a boy was eleven or twelve, he spent most of his time going about in groups with other boys, hunting birds and small animals, sometimes all day and even at night, or playing certain boy's games which I will tell you about. Girls played separately from big boys after this age also. Many girls played until they were fifteen or so. They made wickiups just as we did when younger, but these were larger and better made, about six feet high. Inside they played at household with little children, both boys and girls, though these little kids were just there mainly to watch them. That's the way small children learn to play. The big girls would play at cooking. They didn't pretend mud was their food, the way small children do, but they boiled water, pretending it was tulibai and such things. They used to¬†[Page [facing p.494]]


PLATE VIII


PLAYING AT COOKING


[Page 494]¬†make dolls, really good ones, and clothe them in girl's dresses which they sewed. They made the hair of real hair so that it hung down the back. They made miniature moccasins of buckskin for them. They knew how to make good dolls.


We big boys used to hunt kangaroo rats out in the brush at night-time. We didn't eat them. We just killed them. One time a bunch of us boys went across the river from Dewey Flats and killed a whole sackful. There was an old woman living near by who was so old that she was in her second childhood. She spent most of her time asleep. That night we crept into her wickiup and put the sack of rats at the side of her bed as she slept. She slept with the kangaroo rats all night, not knowing it. Next morning I guess she was mad when she found out. Sometimes we boys hunted quail at night. We crossed back and forth across the Gila River as many as two and three times in a night doing this, even in wintertime. I and one of my cross-cousins were out like this one night. We thought we saw a duck in the river. We shot at it. It was just an old stick. We lost our arrow and so we built a fire and made another one by its light. At other times we went up toward Turn-bull Mountain, where there were many cactus plants growing. The quail roosted on these, and we killed them. Sometimes three or four of us would ride burros out into the hills to shoot doves during their nesting season. They were easy to hit when they sat on the nest. When we went out in the hills to hunt, the oldest boy was always the leader. We went where he said. When we killed birds, sometimes we would stop and cook and eat them.


We used to play at renegades and soldiers. CJ30 played with us. He was a lot older than the rest of us. He always used to take the part of Apache Kid, and one other boy always took the part of a Chiricahua renegade. The rest of us were soldiers and scouts and would try to capture these two. There were two hills where we usually played this game. The renegades would come out on the side of one hill and holler at us. Then they would come out on the other side of the hill and shout. We used horse manure as bullets. If you got hit by one of these bullets, you were dead right there. For our captain we had one lame boy. There were boys older than he who could have been captain, but we made him captain because he could not travel fast and was always in the rear.¬†32¬†





We always played this game at night. One evening when we were playing we saw a man coming riding toward us. We could see the glint of his rifle barrel in the moonlight. It was only the older brother of Elton Causey coming home from a party, but, thinking it was really Apache Kid, we got scared and all ran off. Our captain was left behind. He hollered at us. Later, the same evening, the oldest¬†[Page [facing p. 495]]


PLATE IX


CHILDREN AT PLAY


[Page 495]¬†boys among us went up to where some white men, freighting with wagons, had camped for the night. They crept into the camp and stole some biscuits out of a dutch oven. They took a can of salt too. They brought this back to where the rest of us were waiting. We split the biscuits up between us, put salt on them, and ate them. Each one of us got one. This was to feed us soldiers. The white men must have been very sound asleep. The next morning a white man from the camp climbed up on top of a hill where he could overlook our camps. He thought we had taken the biscuits, but he didn't say anything.


One time I, Charley Sago,¬†nd√®Àôz√©`,¬†and some other boys went down river to where the Yavapai were living. We hung about all day. We saw that the Yavapai had a lot of good melons in their fields. We waited until night and then went into the fields and ate our fill of them. We gathered more melons and took them up to where some Mexican freighters were camped on the road. They gave us a meal and some sugar and coffee in exchange for the melons. We left, and after we had gone a little way we could hear the Mexicans commence to shout. We thought that the Yavapai must have found the Mexicans with their melons and that they would soon be on our trail. We ran for it. After a while we heard someone coming on horseback, so we split up. It was too dark to see. When the rider was close, one of the boys hollered, ‚ÄúHello.‚Äù The man answered ‚ÄúHello‚Äù and went on. After going a way farther, we stopped and built a fire to warm ourselves. From there we went to our homes. When I got home, I found mother telling stories with an old woman. That's the way old women used to do. They had cooked up some corn and were eating it. I had some of the coffee and sugar tied in the corner of my shirt. Mother asked me where I got it, and I told her that the Mexicans had given it to me. But I really got it for the melons I had stolen.


I can't remember the children that I played with before I was ten, but from then on, until I went off to school at fourteen, my two best friends were Paul Nosey and Elton Causey. The first died in school.¬†33¬†


The second didn't go to school at the same time I did, but not long after that mother told me he went to our camp and lay down on my bed and told her, ‚ÄúWell, I guess I'll go to school also.‚Äù He didn't have to go, but he wanted to be with me. The first I knew of it, I saw him there at the school, with his hair already cut like a schoolboy. All three of us were of the same band. We always went about together. Paul was my cross-cousin by clan because his clan was related to that of my father. He was also the son of my mother's half-sister's son. Because of this, our families always camped close together, and that is how I got to know him so well. Elton was of the same clan as Paul and so was also¬†[Page 496]¬†my cross-cousin. Whenever we traveled, Elton and his mother used to accompany us, as she was a great friend of my mother's.


Another boy whom I went about with a great deal was the younger brother of Henry Hudson. He was of my father's clan [also a cross-cousin]. There was a boy named Calvin I used to see a lot of. His father's clan and my father's clan were the same, so we were parallel cousins, but I didn't know he was my brother in this way until very much later.¬†nd√®Àôz√©`,¬†the boy who used to be the leader of the¬†g√°Àôn¬†dances, was also a parallel cousin of mine for the same reason. This I did not know until we had grown up. There were other boys we saw, but I saw most of the first four above. There must have been about twenty-five of us boys who played around together. We were of varying ages. We didn't always play together, but often split up to play in small groups because some would want to go one way, some another. Some days there wasn't anything doing at all, and at other times fathers wouldn't let their boys go off to play because they had work for them to do, such as going after the horses. But whenever we played at games such as scouts and renegades, or held a dance, all of us would be there.


24In connection with a child's knowledge of social practices, Neil Buck once remarked, ‚ÄúAs a small boy I heard older people use the expression which signifies that a widow has been reclaimed in marriage by some kinsman of her dead husband. I used to wonder what it meant, and it was several years before I found out.‚Äù


25¬†Notice that the store is at a distance from the camp, just as it should be. Charge accounts are now the most common way of doing business, although they were less common in former times.

As the baby gets older it manipulates any material that it can get its hands on and these more individual activities will be discussed later. Small boys play with snapping sticks which they cut for themselves out of red-grained wood of a spruce tree. These snapping sticks are about nine inches long and perhaps three-eighths of an inch wide. The game is played by placing a little piece of wood cut about one-half inch square on the end of the stick and snapping it into the air. Boys snap these missiles in order to see who can hurl one the farthest. In his efforts to exceed his playmates, a boy sooner or later breaks his snapping stick. When this [Page 181] occurs he must sit on a near-by log until he is joined by all but one or two of his playmates for the same reason.

a show a method to catch Whisky Jack, the popular pet-bird. This method is popular with women and children. Three or four posts are stuck into the ground in such a way as to support two snow-shoes facing each other on the oblique. A string is attach√®d to one of them above the middle hole, leading through the middle hole of the other snow shoe and terminating in the hands of the bird-catcher who is hidden not far away. A stick carrying a bait is set into the weave of the snow-shoes. When a Whisky Jack arrives he sits on the stick in order to pick on the bait. The bird-catcher pulls the string and squeezes the bird between the two snow shoes in such a way that he cannot escape, but without hurting him. The two holes in the snow-shoes are filled with leaves and grass to prevent the escape of the bird. Whisky Jack is rarely eaten, mostly he is tamed.

The social organization of the Western Apache",SLING,Weapons,Comp,High,Mini,YES,NO,NO,YES,NO,NO,NO,NA,NA,NA,NA,Boys,NA,NA,NA,NA,North America,Primarily Hunter-gatherers,"A regular game which older boys and youths played was called da≈Çitc'oÀôldi'. It was a mock war game but fought out in imitation of real warfare. Apparently it is not to be confused with the play at war and raiding already described by Anna Price, in which girls and younger children might also join. The boys divided into two groups and sent notice when they intended to fight. They used slings, and often the stones found their mark, doing considerable damage. Older men sat about at a distance and watched the sport, encouraging the boys. Sometimes they would fire their guns off in the air to make it seem real. This game trained the boys in fighting. John Rope says of it: We used to divide into sides and make war on each other. Each side held a war dance, just like the real thing. There always used to be an old man at these dances who would direct us in carrying it out properly. [Page 486] One boy was chosen as chief on each side, a boy who was not afraid 23 


23 For mention of a boy looked upon as chief by his playmates see p. 670, n. I.


When we started in to fight each other, the chiefs led us. After the battle started, one or two would be captured. We would whip them with sticks and make them bring rocks to us for our slings. When one battle was over, we met and agreed to have another battle on a certain day. We fought mainly with slings, but when we got close enough we just picked up rocks and threw them. I used to play that way.


In my time there were two boy leaders, one who was our chief and one who was the leader of the tc√°Àôtc√¨Àôdn [clan] side. One time when we were set to have a battle, these two boys each made their men line up behind them. Then they walked out in front and prepared to fight each other singly with slings. The tc√°Àôtc√¨Àôdn leader threw first, but our chief ducked and the rock went over his head. Then he got up and made believe he was about to throw at the tc√°Àôtc√¨Àôdn chief. The latter ducked, and, when he did, our chief really threw and hit him right in the back of the head. He was knocked unconscious and bled a lot. All our boys thought he was dead. We were scared and ran off. We were so scared that we never stopped even when we reached our own homes. After that fight, the two sides agreed to meet again. In the battle which followed, one of our boys got caught by the tc√°Àôtc√¨Àôdn chief who had been hit the time before. He was still thinking about it I guess. He got two of his men to help him. They held our boy while they stuck sharp sticks into his thighs until his legs bled. Then they took everything he had, his sling and all, and turned him loose. He came back to us crying, with nothing.",NA,NA,https://ehrafworldcultures.yale.edu/sres/b87bd7ae-9920-4070-a620-d2fd9ba51db5,33.86,-110.12,1942,5580,Play,Single

Once in a great while, with the exception of a feast, where the preoccupation is different, one may see a number of them joined in play.

Not uncommonly one will see a spinning-top (ÀônUnt(…î)maƒç√´; Tessmann,¬†n√≥tomas) made of a tucum√£ nut, with a lateral hole and a wooden peg; it is spun by a cord twisted about this peg, the loop fastening the top being jerked by the left hand, which secures it.

made of a piece of gourd with serrated edges. The bull-roarer (brinquedo do c√£o) is rare; some say that it came to the Tukuna as a Neobrazilian game. Little girls and young maidens sometimes pass the time making cat's cradles with an endless cord, stretching it between the fingers and toes and using the teeth as an aid.





3¬†In Brazil, non-Indians make this toy out of a button with a string threaded through the holes, the free ends being knotted together. Holding the extreme ends of the double loop in both hands, the operator winds up the string tightly by a looping motion for which the button provides the weight.

In winter, particularly in more isolated, smaller camps, one is likely to see a gun standing on its butt in the snow, with some kind of case or rags over it. In winter this is wise; for taking a gun from the relatively warm temperature of a tent to the cold outside, often allows condensation and freezing. This is particularly true of ‚Äúrepeaters‚Äù and automatic or semi-automatic weapons. The Indians are well aware of this from long experience, and this fact seems to have something to do with their predilection for single shot rifles. From the time of the early traders these Indians have taken over the rifle. They have, generally speaking, abandoned the use of the bow and arrow, although at times it is still used by adults for bird shooting, both because homemade arrows are cheaper than bullets and because there is relatively no noise in its use, and not as much destruction of the meat as with shells. However, today, the bow, with blunt wooden arrows, serves chiefly as a hunting instrument for young boys, and as a toy for both young and older males. It is still a matter of pride and of conversation among adults when a young boy kills his first game, usually a bird or a squirrel, with his bow and arrow, although there is no ceremony attached to this event. The earlier a boy [Page 122] kills his first game, the better hunter he will be.

Dolls are described briefly by Spier, ibid.


Through their use the girl is encouraged in many of her future activities of housekeeping. A few boys like to play with dolls too, but they are teased about this girlish activity and soon cease. It is the girl‚Äôs mother or grandmother who first shows her how to make dolls and play with them. They are fashioned from any available material; wood, bark, tules, and clay are all utilized. In lieu of anything better they may even be outlined in the sand. Once the technique has been learned, the girls manufacture their own dolls and play with them alone or in groups. They make little shelters of willow for the dolls, pretend to dig up roots for them, and in every way treat them as actual children. Often the dolls are placed on a piece of bark to represent the cradleboard. Apparently much of this play is spontaneous on the part of the girls, but there is also considerable suggestion and encouragement on the part of mother and grandmother.",NA,NA,https://ehrafworldcultures.yale.edu/sres/c24b6f44-021c-4449-af45-de43c9968f39,42,-121.31,1950,1488,Play,Multiple

For this they need a ball (ano ni warebwi, Fig. 121a), which is freshly woven in the shape of a cube from the halves of six (or also of four) pinnules of a coconut frond by a girl or a woman (cf. 31, film 51). First an inner part is made, around which an outer skin is then woven. It is possible to play the game with just two partners. Usually, however, about ten or twelve girls between about nine and fourteen years old take part. The players choose two captains, who choose their teams (of equal numbers) which then line up opposite each other. The captains stand wherever they like among their team. One of the two teams starts the game; if they cannot agree about which one, lots are drawn (e.g. with a small stone hidden in one hand). The captain decides which girl of her team shall play first. The selected person kicks the light ball with the inside (or the top) of her right foot (or with her left, if this has previously been agreed as one of the rules) up in the air as many times as she can, until the ano falls to the ground. Everyone counts the number of times she hits the ball. When it falls to the ground, then the next girl in the same team takes her place, the counting starts again and the number of points is added to the total of the previous player. Once all the girls in the first team have had a turn, the second begins to play, the points it scores naturally being totalled separately. The team with the greatest number of total points is the winner. That can bring the game to a [Page 234] conclusion. Usually, however, the defeated team requests another game with fresh rules, e.g. for a player to have to use the outside of the foot or the knee to hit the ball, with the usual sequence of events and scoring. The game ends with the final defeat of one of the teams ‚Äî or it breaks up when some of the girls go off, because they are thirsty or have got bored with playing. If the game has been played to the end, the losers receive a jocular ‚Äòpunishment‚Äô from the members of the victorious team, who strike them symbolically on the forehead and hands.",2415.1,"Ball (ano ni warebwi) for the warebwi game.

For this they need a cubic ball (ano ni bwebwe), which is smaller than the ano ni warebwi and mostly woven from strips of pandanus leaf (though more rarely from the less durable pinnules of a coconut frond (Fig. 121b). Eight or ten girls can take part in the game, once again dividing into two teams each with a leader. The latter are usually older and stronger than the rest of the participants. A line is drawn and around it circular areas are marked for the players. To start things off the first player (usually the leader) goes up to the line and throws the ball with her right hand in the direction of the other team, which attempts to catch it. If it succeeds it is its turn to throw the ball. If the ball falls to the ground, then it is returned and the second player of the first team throws it. In the case of a false throw a second attempt is permitted. If there is a particularly strong throw, causing the ball to go a long way, then a player will shout out ‚Äúbon au bai‚Äù (‚Äúthat's my ball‚Äù) and run quickly from the circle of the players. Both leaders may try to make a valid throw three times, but if they make a long throw they have to run round the players' circle five times. The latter is not always occupied according to the rules. No points are scored and no winner emerges. The teams part when the participants are no longer interested in playing. For a simplified version, also called bwebwe, girls of the same age use a similar ball made from the pinnules of a coconut frond or strips of pandanus leaf. One girl stands in front of a line of players and throws the ball to any one of them. The girl in question has to catch the ball and then change places with the thrower and throw the ano to another player.",2416.1,"Ball (ano ni bwebwe) for the game of bwebwe. Autukia, Nonouti.

According to Lista (b):139 is ‚Äúla honda poco usada, pero la manejan con admirable destreza /the sling [is] little used, but they handle it with admirable dexterity/‚Äù; solemnly circumstantial, Gallardo:294 writes: ‚ÄúDebo citar el caso de haber visto entre los onas una honda, arma que casi no usan /I must cite the case of having seen a sling among the Ona, a weapon that they practically do not use/‚Äù. (27) 


Since he came across this weapon so rarely, he regards most Selk'nam as incapable of making it and thinks it was introduced by a Yamana woman. -- It is well known that old legends tell how powerfully this and that ancestor wielded his sling. Cf. Beauvior (b):204, and Cojazzi:79.


[Page 343] 243 cont. And yet the boys are constantly going about with it and amuse themselves for hours. Though for the present they are merely following their instinct for play, they nevertheless attain great sureness; in typical boy fashion, they like to aim at small birds. During the day a man will kill the resting wild geese and cormorants only with the sling, upon which he places three to five walnut-sized stones at one time. He directs them at the heads of the birds. The northern people sometimes also use this weapon to kill cururos. In battle one reached for it when the arrows had run out. (28) 


Brown, for example, mentions that this weapon was even used in defensive warfare against Europeans: A soldier ‚Äúrecibi√≥ una pedrada, lanzada con honda, cuyo proyectil se le incrust√≥ entre dos costillas y con el enterrado en la carne anduvo hasta que le fu√© extraido despu√©s en Valparaiso /received a blow with a stone, thrown with a sling, whose projectile was embedded between two ribs and with the stone embedded in his flesh he walked about until it was removed later in Valparaiso/‚Äù ...


On the whole, our Indians use their sling only for special purposes, although no man, and even much less a boy, lacks it.

Acer glabrum


Small cases of the folded bark contained the grease which was mixed with ochre to make paint. A larger carrying case was made of the same material and worn under the left arm.


Allium spp.


A piece of hide was dipped in a decoction of¬†Allium¬†bulb and used to shine arrows. The bulbs were also rubbed on quivers as a deodorant.


Amelanchier alnifolia


Favors were asked while presenting a gift of four of the berries. The receiver was obliged to return the goodwill. Girls played a game whilÀúe harvesting the berries. After some berries had been gathered the girls would sit together and hold their breath while another called out ‚Äòtops, tops, tops‚Äô at a regular beat. Each girl put a berry in her bag for every call and the one who held her breath the longest won all the other girls‚Äô berries.


Anemone patens


Because the plant acted as vessicant, pranks were played on unsuspecting people who would ask someone to fetch them some toilet paper. It worked especially well at night.


Arctostaphylos uva-ursi


The dry berries were put in rattles¬†(Fig. 33). They were preferred over stones because they were lighter and didn‚Äôt make dust, a constant¬†[Page 108]


[Page 109]¬†problem during long ceremonies in which many rattles were used.


The dry berries were strung on necklaces.


This berry was the one used by the girl who escaped from the cannibal in the story of the Lost Children (Wissler,¬†Mythology of the Blackfoot Indians, p. 128).


Artemisia campestris


An infusion of the root was rubbed on a hide that was being tanned.


Artemisia frigida

In the preparation of rattles, the skin was moulded around balls of the plant.


Paint applicators made from broken shoulder blades of buffalo or cattle were cleaned with¬†A. frigida, then dipped in another color.


Quantities of the plant were put on campfire coals and the smoke repelled mosquitoes.


Children played a game of clubbing gophers unconcious and reviving them holding the crushed leaves to the animal‚Äôs nostrils.


Hides were treated with water in which the plant had been soaked or brewed.


Aster spp.


The various color forms of this genus were thought to be the effect of aging rather than indicative of taxonomic difference. The sequence went from white to blue and finally yellow.


The Holy Woman of the Sun Dance wore a necklace of the yellow form.


Children rubbed the flowers on their bouncing arrows for color.


[Page 110]


[Page 111]


Castilleja spp.


Children rubbed the flowers on their bouncing arrows for color and shine.


Arrow feathers were dyed a light yellow by combining them with the flowers and keeping them under pressure for a few hours.


The flowers were used to shine and waterproof hides.


The color forms were considered the effect of age, the sequence moving from white to red to yellow.


Clematis verticellaris


The plant, a creeping vine, was called ‚Äúghost rope‚Äù because it covered trees and bushes in a mysterious way. The leaves were used in the removal of ‚Äúghost bullets‚Äù (supernatural objects that were shot into people by ghosts). The bullets were removed by a diviner either with a sucking tube or through a slit in the skin made by a flint. Then the leaves were boiled and applied to the place where the bullets were removed. Fainting was often the result of coming near a ghost and the victim was revived with a smudge of the stem of this plant. At night, children wore the flowers in their hair to keep ghosts away.


Cornus stolonifera


According to a certain myth there was a time when the bark of this bush was white and not red. Naapi saw some gophers playing in the warm ashes of a campfire. They would bury each other in the ashes and when it got too hot they would cry out and the others would uncover them. Naapi joined the game and persuaded them all to get in the ashes. Only a pregnant gopher resisted and Naapi let her go, saying that she was necessary to propogate the species. Then he roasted the gophers and made a frame of¬†cornus stolonifera¬†which he used as a plate while he ate them. That was how the¬†[Page 112]¬†bark turned red and to this day the grease from the gophers drips from the branches when they are heated.


When the usual wood could not be found, the stems of¬†C. stolonifera¬†were used to make pipestems and tamps.


Delphinium bicolor


The flowers were mixed in water and used to dye quills a light blue.


Elaeagnus commutata


This bush obtained the name ‚Äúexcrement smell‚Äù from the story of Naapi and the Gophers. Naapi punished his anus for failing to guard his roasted gophers from a lynx by hitting it with a branch of this plant. From that time on the wood smelled like excrement when it was burned and those who used it for firewood were chided for being lazy.


In craft, the seeds were cleaned, boiled, threaded and hung to dry. Then they were greased and made into necklaces. Sometimes the seeds were interspaced with¬†Juniperus¬†berries. Also, the bark of the bush was braided and used to whip the stone tops which children spun on the ice during winter. These whips usually lasted longer than the rawhide ones.


Epilobium angustifolium


The flowers were rubbed on rawhide thongs and mittens for waterproofing.


During the winter the powdered inner cortex was put on the hands and face to protect them from the cold. It was especially useful when the hands were uncovered for skinning, etc. When the powder was used, the hands would not hurt when they warmed up again.


Equisetum arvense


Children used the plant to shine their bouncing arrows.


The powdered stems were put in moccasins to avoid foot cramps when traveling long distances.


[Page 113]


Also, the stems¬†A¬†


(A¬†/The stems of¬†Equisetum arvense--Analyst/)





were crushed and combined with porcupine quills which had been quartered longitudinally. Both were stored under pressure in a moose bladder-bag until the quills turned a light pink.


Evernia vulpina


A yellow dye was produced from pieces of this lichen which was combined under pressure with porcupine quills.


‚ÄúFish-backbone‚Äù


The root was immersed in water which was later used to soak a green hide. Then the hide was stored for tanning.


Gaillardia aristata


The flower heads were rubbed on rawhide bags for waterproofing. Also, the flowerheads were used to absorb soups and broth and served as spoons for the sick and invalid.


Glycyrrhiza lepidota


The burrs of this plant received the name ‚ÄúTakes-a-Woman-By-Force‚Äù because, like a man to a woman, they attach themselves so readily.


It was believed that ghosts shot their victims with parts of the burr, thereby inflicting disease. If the ‚Äúmysterious bullet‚Äù was not extracted by a diviner the patient was sure to die or his face would contort and he would go dumb.


Buffalo runners kept the burrs in the mouth to protect against thirst.


Heracleum lantum


The hollow stems of the plant were made into children‚Äôs flutes. They also served as toy blowgun, with bullets furnished by choke-cherry pits. Schaeffer records a variation of the blowgun idea amongst the South Peigan. Children would cut off a section of the dry stem and plug one end with a¬†[Page 114]¬†flowerhead of ‚Äúgumweed‚Äù (probably¬†Grindelia squarrosa). The stem¬†A¬†


(A¬†/The stem of¬†Heracleum lantum--Analyst/)





was filled with water, the top end plugged in the same way and a stick was fitted into the bottom to afford a piston-like action for squirting the water out the far end. The child used his squirt-gun to kill crickets and such, after which he declared that he had ‚Äúkilled his meat‚Äù.


Infirm people would use the stems to suck soup and stew without raising up.


Hierchloe odorata


Saddles were packed with this grass (as well as sage) to keep them smelling good.


Juniperus spp.


Women collected quantities of the berry, inserted small sticks through them, and dried them. Then grease was poured over campfire coals and the berries held in the thick smoke which turned them black. The berries were polished and strung on rawhide thongs for necklaces, wristlets, or clothing decorations. Sometimes they were interspersed with¬†Eleagnus¬†berries.


Hides were yellowed in the smoke of the greased leaves.


‚Äú¬†Kah-pook-see‚Äù


This wood was sought in the making of pipestems and was considered very valuable because it was obtained only after hazardous travel into the Big Horn River country. A horse and several blankets might be paid for a single piece suitable for one pipestem. Pipe tamps were made of the same wood.


Lithospernum ruderale


Children nicknamed this plant ‚Äúholy turnip‚Äù and used the stems as headpieces in their play, probably mimicking the affairs of the Holy Woman who owned the Natoas Bundle.


[Page 115]


Lomatium triternatum


Animal pelts which were used in bundles were stuffed with the fruits of this plant during the tanning process and that kept them from smelling.


A porcupine foot was stuffed with the fruits and tied on a young girl‚Äôs hair as a good luck charm.


Lonicera involucrata


The bush was named ‚Äúbear eats them‚Äù because the berries were considered inedible by humans.


Lygodesmia juncea


The stems, rich in latex, were crushed, put in a storage bag and later used as foot pads in moccasins. Also, newly tanned buffalo hides were ochred red with a mixture of the stem and ochre which actually waterproofed the hide.


Mammilaria vivipara


Jokes were played on people by placing this cactus under covers, etc.


Monarda fistulosa


The dry flowerheads were used by invalids for sucking broth and soup. Women used the dry flowerheads to apply water to a green hide which made it easier to scrape the hide with even strokes.


Osmorhiza occidentalis


Pieces of the root were kept in quivers and clothing as a deodorant. The stems were combined with ochre and the mixture applied to robes.


Oxytropus sericea


Children made headdresses with the stems, lined up (alternating boys and girls) and danced single-file to different spots while singing this song in unison: ‚Äúthere‚Äôs nothing behind my back‚Äù. The seeds would rattle¬†[Page 116]¬†in their pods. Then the leader would suddenly stop and look behind him while the others dropped to the ground. The leader struck whoever remained standing with a smoking stick which he carried. Then he took some of the seeds of the plant, chewed them and applied the mixture to the burn. Shortly the irritation stopped and the game continued with changing leaders.


Perideridia gairdneri


The plant was rubbed on arrows for shine and waterproofing. Buffalo runners chewed the roots to extend their endurance.


Phlox hoodii


Apparently, a dye was obtained from this plant in the way as¬†Evernia.


Pinus spp.


The origin of coniferous forests was told in the story of the woman who married a snake and later pursued her brothers who had killed the snakebeing. While the boys were fleeing southward, one of them threw √£ porcupine tail which magically created a forest that sprang up as a barrier to the woman‚Äôs detached head which rolled in hot pursuit. The woman had the special power of seeing through anything and soon spotted the boys on the other side of the forest. Meanwhile they prayed for the trees to have children and so replenish the barrier between them and certain death at the hands of the woman. The story continues with the creation of the mountains, etc.


Five variations of conifer were distinguished: ‚Äúcurly pine‚Äù (from the lichen growths on the branches of Pinus contorta), ‚Äúmean pine‚Äù (also ‚Äúsweet pine‚Äù,¬†Abies lasiocarpa), ‚Äútomato scent pine‚Äù (¬†Thuja spp.), ‚Äúred pine‚Äù (¬†Pseudotsuga menziesii?), and ‚Äúcedar pine‚Äù (¬†Juniperus spp.?).


Travois and tipi poles were made from¬†Pinus contorta¬†while the young¬†[Page 117]¬†trees furnished back-rest poles and bed supports. The back-rest poles were cut about five forearms in length and dried over a fire of rotten logs. One end of the pole was perforated and the other end sharpened. Then a stick was inserted through the hole and the pole etched. Later it was painted red and blue with buffalo shoulder-blade applicators. Back-rest poles were often notched to record the number of camp moves.


Story-sticks were prepared by older men and presented to children in return for favors. The sticks were notched to count the number of stories that the man would tell the child. They were often varnished with a solution of boiled hoof and steer phallus and sometimes red ochre was added. Then the stick was polished with a piece of rawhide. Story-sticks were sometimes used to hang tipi doors.


Wind chimes were made and presented to newly married couples. Little sticks were also prepared and notched to act as fasteners on designated foot-storage bags.


Bowls were fashioned from pine burls¬†(Fig. 35). The process was to apply grease to the burl, scrape with a rough stone, apply more grease and repeat the process until the bowl was finished. If grease was not used the bowl would crack.


The resin of¬†Pinus contorta¬†was boiled with buffalo phallus and used as a glue for headdresses and bows. It was also applied to moccasins for waterproofing.


Polyporus spp.


This fungus was often taken from the mountains (stolen occasionally from the Kooteney Indians) or detached from willows. Then it was scraped with a knife and attached to ‚ÄúWeasel-robes‚Äù when it could be used in emergency first-aid treatment. It was a styptic on wounds and boiled with¬†Psoralea¬†[Page 118]


[Page 119]¬†esculenta¬†to treat coughs. The infusion of the fungus was taken to stop diarrhea and treat dysentery.


Populus tremuloides


Whistles were made by loosening the bark of a branch replacing it and blowing through it. Another type of whistle was made by blowing through the moistened leaves.


Potentilla anserina


The runners of the plant were used to fix leggins in place. The leggings were tied above the knee and then folded over to the ankle, like a boot. Girls used the runners to tie blankets. Though the runners did not hold their strength long, they were easily replaced.


Potentilla fruticosa


The plant, a small bush, was called ‚Äúdeer seat‚Äù because the animals were often found resting in clearings where the plant was common.


Pillows were sometimes filled with the leaves.


Prunus virginiana


The straight branches were used in making back-rests¬†(Fig. 36). The hard wood, which did not burn easily, was used in making incense tongs¬†(Fig. 37)¬†and roasting skewers.


‚Äòsoralea esculenta


Pieces of the root were dried and attached to clothing and robes as ornamentation and medicine. Sometimes this root was scraped and used to replace the pieces of¬†Polyporus¬†which was attached to ‚ÄúWeasel-robes‚Äù.


Ribes aureum


The Sarsi Indians were a constant source of humor to the Blackfoot. Because they were Beaver Indians who were in the midst of adopting a plains¬†[Page 120]


[Page 122]¬†mode, they were often considered awkward and clumsy. For example, it is said that they had to be taught to put ear-flaps on their lodges so that the smoke would be controlled.


This plant received the name, ‚ÄúSarsi punctures-berry‚Äù, because while the berries looked like the ‚Äúreal punctures-berry‚Äù (¬†Ribes oxyacanthoides), they didn‚Äôt taste as good and were considered ‚Äúfakes‚Äù.


Ribes oxyacanthoides


Children played a game with the berries of this bush. They sat in a circle and began counting to ten, each child counting one number around the circle. The tenth child would take five berries and eat them at once, trying his best not to show a bitter face. If he was successful, the child next to him would do the same and this would continue until one grimaced at the sour taste. He was then struck on the thigh with a knuckle-punch, thus giving the name ‚Äúpunctured-berry‚Äù to the plant. The child who never grimaced won all the others‚Äô berry supplies.


Rubus parviflora


The berries were considered inedible and the plant named ‚Äúbear-eats-them‚Äù to denote the fact.


The berries were used to dye tanned robes. They were smeared over a new hide and dried in the sun. Then they were scraped off and the hide polished until it shone.


The berry was applied to quivers to strengthen them.


Salix spp.


A buzzing whistle was made by loosening the bark around a branch and blowing through it.


The boughs were cut and used in making back-rest slats and sweatlodge frames.


[Page 123]


Spiraea densiflora


The flowering stems were used as paint brushes, especially on the large spaces of tipis.


Thacictrum occidentalis


The fruits were kept as a household and clothing deodorant and were often crushed and mixed with paint for a robe, etc.


Thermopsis rhombifolia


The flowering of this plant signaled the time when the sponsorers of the Holy Lodge were to begin collecting buffalo tongues in preparation for the Sun Dance. It was also the time when the buffalo were fat enough for good hunting.


Arrow shafts were rubbed with the yellow petals for coloring.


Viola adunca


Apparently, a blue dye was obtained from this plant which was used in dying arrows.",NA,NA,https://ehrafworldcultures.yale.edu/sres/cb16844b-1215-4b41-b933-40f1911bb271,49.34,-111.21,1974,6278,Play,Single

Acer glabrum


Small cases of the folded bark contained the grease which was mixed with ochre to make paint. A larger carrying case was made of the same material and worn under the left arm.


Allium spp.


A piece of hide was dipped in a decoction of¬†Allium¬†bulb and used to shine arrows. The bulbs were also rubbed on quivers as a deodorant.


Amelanchier alnifolia


Favors were asked while presenting a gift of four of the berries. The receiver was obliged to return the goodwill. Girls played a game whilÀúe harvesting the berries. After some berries had been gathered the girls would sit together and hold their breath while another called out ‚Äòtops, tops, tops‚Äô at a regular beat. Each girl put a berry in her bag for every call and the one who held her breath the longest won all the other girls‚Äô berries.


Anemone patens


Because the plant acted as vessicant, pranks were played on unsuspecting people who would ask someone to fetch them some toilet paper. It worked especially well at night.


Arctostaphylos uva-ursi


The dry berries were put in rattles¬†(Fig. 33). They were preferred over stones because they were lighter and didn‚Äôt make dust, a constant¬†[Page 108]


[Page 109]¬†problem during long ceremonies in which many rattles were used.


The dry berries were strung on necklaces.


This berry was the one used by the girl who escaped from the cannibal in the story of the Lost Children (Wissler,¬†Mythology of the Blackfoot Indians, p. 128).


Artemisia campestris


An infusion of the root was rubbed on a hide that was being tanned.


Artemisia frigida


For deodorant, saddles,¬†(Fig. 34)¬†womens‚Äô pillows, hide bags and quivers were stuffed with¬†Artemisia frigida¬†and¬†A. ludoviciana.


In the preparation of rattles, the skin was moulded around balls of the plant.


Paint applicators made from broken shoulder blades of buffalo or cattle were cleaned with¬†A. frigida, then dipped in another color.


Quantities of the plant were put on campfire coals and the smoke repelled mosquitoes.


Children played a game of clubbing gophers unconcious and reviving them holding the crushed leaves to the animal‚Äôs nostrils.


Hides were treated with water in which the plant had been soaked or brewed.


Aster spp.


The various color forms of this genus were thought to be the effect of aging rather than indicative of taxonomic difference. The sequence went from white to blue and finally yellow.


The Holy Woman of the Sun Dance wore a necklace of the yellow form.


Children rubbed the flowers on their bouncing arrows for color.


[Page 110]


[Page 111]


Castilleja spp.


Children rubbed the flowers on their bouncing arrows for color and shine.


Arrow feathers were dyed a light yellow by combining them with the flowers and keeping them under pressure for a few hours.


The flowers were used to shine and waterproof hides.


The color forms were considered the effect of age, the sequence moving from white to red to yellow.


Clematis verticellaris


The plant, a creeping vine, was called ‚Äúghost rope‚Äù because it covered trees and bushes in a mysterious way. The leaves were used in the removal of ‚Äúghost bullets‚Äù (supernatural objects that were shot into people by ghosts). The bullets were removed by a diviner either with a sucking tube or through a slit in the skin made by a flint. Then the leaves were boiled and applied to the place where the bullets were removed. Fainting was often the result of coming near a ghost and the victim was revived with a smudge of the stem of this plant. At night, children wore the flowers in their hair to keep ghosts away.


Cornus stolonifera


According to a certain myth there was a time when the bark of this bush was white and not red. Naapi saw some gophers playing in the warm ashes of a campfire. They would bury each other in the ashes and when it got too hot they would cry out and the others would uncover them. Naapi joined the game and persuaded them all to get in the ashes. Only a pregnant gopher resisted and Naapi let her go, saying that she was necessary to propogate the species. Then he roasted the gophers and made a frame of¬†cornus stolonifera¬†which he used as a plate while he ate them. That was how the¬†[Page 112]¬†bark turned red and to this day the grease from the gophers drips from the branches when they are heated.


When the usual wood could not be found, the stems of¬†C. stolonifera¬†were used to make pipestems and tamps.


Delphinium bicolor


The flowers were mixed in water and used to dye quills a light blue.


Elaeagnus commutata


This bush obtained the name ‚Äúexcrement smell‚Äù from the story of Naapi and the Gophers. Naapi punished his anus for failing to guard his roasted gophers from a lynx by hitting it with a branch of this plant. From that time on the wood smelled like excrement when it was burned and those who used it for firewood were chided for being lazy.


In craft, the seeds were cleaned, boiled, threaded and hung to dry. Then they were greased and made into necklaces. Sometimes the seeds were interspaced with¬†Juniperus¬†berries. Also, the bark of the bush was braided and used to whip the stone tops which children spun on the ice during winter. These whips usually lasted longer than the rawhide ones.


Epilobium angustifolium


The flowers were rubbed on rawhide thongs and mittens for waterproofing.


During the winter the powdered inner cortex was put on the hands and face to protect them from the cold. It was especially useful when the hands were uncovered for skinning, etc. When the powder was used, the hands would not hurt when they warmed up again.


Equisetum arvense


Children used the plant to shine their bouncing arrows.


The powdered stems were put in moccasins to avoid foot cramps when traveling long distances.


[Page 113]


Also, the stems¬†A¬†


(A¬†/The stems of¬†Equisetum arvense--Analyst/)





were crushed and combined with porcupine quills which had been quartered longitudinally. Both were stored under pressure in a moose bladder-bag until the quills turned a light pink.


Evernia vulpina


A yellow dye was produced from pieces of this lichen which was combined under pressure with porcupine quills.


‚ÄúFish-backbone‚Äù


The root was immersed in water which was later used to soak a green hide. Then the hide was stored for tanning.


Gaillardia aristata


The flower heads were rubbed on rawhide bags for waterproofing. Also, the flowerheads were used to absorb soups and broth and served as spoons for the sick and invalid.


Glycyrrhiza lepidota


The burrs of this plant received the name ‚ÄúTakes-a-Woman-By-Force‚Äù because, like a man to a woman, they attach themselves so readily.


It was believed that ghosts shot their victims with parts of the burr, thereby inflicting disease. If the ‚Äúmysterious bullet‚Äù was not extracted by a diviner the patient was sure to die or his face would contort and he would go dumb.


Buffalo runners kept the burrs in the mouth to protect against thirst.


Heracleum lantum


The hollow stems of the plant were made into children‚Äôs flutes. They also served as toy blowgun, with bullets furnished by choke-cherry pits. Schaeffer records a variation of the blowgun idea amongst the South Peigan. Children would cut off a section of the dry stem and plug one end with a¬†[Page 114]¬†flowerhead of ‚Äúgumweed‚Äù (probably¬†Grindelia squarrosa). The stem¬†A¬†


(A¬†/The stem of¬†Heracleum lantum--Analyst/)





was filled with water, the top end plugged in the same way and a stick was fitted into the bottom to afford a piston-like action for squirting the water out the far end. The child used his squirt-gun to kill crickets and such, after which he declared that he had ‚Äúkilled his meat‚Äù.


Infirm people would use the stems to suck soup and stew without raising up.


Hierchloe odorata


Saddles were packed with this grass (as well as sage) to keep them smelling good.


Juniperus spp.


Women collected quantities of the berry, inserted small sticks through them, and dried them. Then grease was poured over campfire coals and the berries held in the thick smoke which turned them black. The berries were polished and strung on rawhide thongs for necklaces, wristlets, or clothing decorations. Sometimes they were interspersed with¬†Eleagnus¬†berries.


Hides were yellowed in the smoke of the greased leaves.


‚Äú¬†Kah-pook-see‚Äù


This wood was sought in the making of pipestems and was considered very valuable because it was obtained only after hazardous travel into the Big Horn River country. A horse and several blankets might be paid for a single piece suitable for one pipestem. Pipe tamps were made of the same wood.


Lithospernum ruderale


Children nicknamed this plant ‚Äúholy turnip‚Äù and used the stems as headpieces in their play, probably mimicking the affairs of the Holy Woman who owned the Natoas Bundle.


[Page 115]


Lomatium triternatum


Animal pelts which were used in bundles were stuffed with the fruits of this plant during the tanning process and that kept them from smelling.


A porcupine foot was stuffed with the fruits and tied on a young girl‚Äôs hair as a good luck charm.


Lonicera involucrata


The bush was named ‚Äúbear eats them‚Äù because the berries were considered inedible by humans.


Lygodesmia juncea


The stems, rich in latex, were crushed, put in a storage bag and later used as foot pads in moccasins. Also, newly tanned buffalo hides were ochred red with a mixture of the stem and ochre which actually waterproofed the hide.


Mammilaria vivipara


Jokes were played on people by placing this cactus under covers, etc.


Monarda fistulosa


The dry flowerheads were used by invalids for sucking broth and soup. Women used the dry flowerheads to apply water to a green hide which made it easier to scrape the hide with even strokes.


Osmorhiza occidentalis


Pieces of the root were kept in quivers and clothing as a deodorant. The stems were combined with ochre and the mixture applied to robes.


Oxytropus sericea


Children made headdresses with the stems, lined up (alternating boys and girls) and danced single-file to different spots while singing this song in unison: ‚Äúthere‚Äôs nothing behind my back‚Äù. The seeds would rattle¬†[Page 116]¬†in their pods. Then the leader would suddenly stop and look behind him while the others dropped to the ground. The leader struck whoever remained standing with a smoking stick which he carried. Then he took some of the seeds of the plant, chewed them and applied the mixture to the burn. Shortly the irritation stopped and the game continued with changing leaders.


Perideridia gairdneri


The plant was rubbed on arrows for shine and waterproofing. Buffalo runners chewed the roots to extend their endurance.


Phlox hoodii


Apparently, a dye was obtained from this plant in the way as¬†Evernia.

Travois and tipi poles were made from¬†Pinus contorta¬†while the young¬†[Page 117]¬†trees furnished back-rest poles and bed supports. The back-rest poles were cut about five forearms in length and dried over a fire of rotten logs. One end of the pole was perforated and the other end sharpened. Then a stick was inserted through the hole and the pole etched. Later it was painted red and blue with buffalo shoulder-blade applicators. Back-rest poles were often notched to record the number of camp moves.

was filled with water, the top end plugged in the same way and a stick was fitted into the bottom to afford a piston-like action for squirting the water out the far end. The child used his squirt-gun to kill crickets and such, after which he declared that he had ‚Äúkilled his meat‚Äù.


Infirm people would use the stems to suck soup and stew without raising up.


Hierchloe odorata


Saddles were packed with this grass (as well as sage) to keep them smelling good.


Juniperus spp.


Women collected quantities of the berry, inserted small sticks through them, and dried them. Then grease was poured over campfire coals and the berries held in the thick smoke which turned them black. The berries were polished and strung on rawhide thongs for necklaces, wristlets, or clothing decorations. Sometimes they were interspersed with¬†Eleagnus¬†berries.


Hides were yellowed in the smoke of the greased leaves.


‚Äú¬†Kah-pook-see‚Äù


This wood was sought in the making of pipestems and was considered very valuable because it was obtained only after hazardous travel into the Big Horn River country. A horse and several blankets might be paid for a single piece suitable for one pipestem. Pipe tamps were made of the same wood.


Lithospernum ruderale


Children nicknamed this plant ‚Äúholy turnip‚Äù and used the stems as headpieces in their play, probably mimicking the affairs of the Holy Woman who owned the Natoas Bundle.


[Page 115]


Lomatium triternatum


Animal pelts which were used in bundles were stuffed with the fruits of this plant during the tanning process and that kept them from smelling.


A porcupine foot was stuffed with the fruits and tied on a young girl‚Äôs hair as a good luck charm.


Lonicera involucrata


The bush was named ‚Äúbear eats them‚Äù because the berries were considered inedible by humans.


Lygodesmia juncea


The stems, rich in latex, were crushed, put in a storage bag and later used as foot pads in moccasins. Also, newly tanned buffalo hides were ochred red with a mixture of the stem and ochre which actually waterproofed the hide.


Mammilaria vivipara


Jokes were played on people by placing this cactus under covers, etc.


Monarda fistulosa


The dry flowerheads were used by invalids for sucking broth and soup. Women used the dry flowerheads to apply water to a green hide which made it easier to scrape the hide with even strokes.


Osmorhiza occidentalis


Pieces of the root were kept in quivers and clothing as a deodorant. The stems were combined with ochre and the mixture applied to robes.


Oxytropus sericea


Children made headdresses with the stems, lined up (alternating boys and girls) and danced single-file to different spots while singing this song in unison: ‚Äúthere‚Äôs nothing behind my back‚Äù. The seeds would rattle¬†[Page 116]¬†in their pods. Then the leader would suddenly stop and look behind him while the others dropped to the ground. The leader struck whoever remained standing with a smoking stick which he carried. Then he took some of the seeds of the plant, chewed them and applied the mixture to the burn. Shortly the irritation stopped and the game continued with changing leaders.


Perideridia gairdneri


The plant was rubbed on arrows for shine and waterproofing. Buffalo runners chewed the roots to extend their endurance.


Phlox hoodii


Apparently, a dye was obtained from this plant in the way as¬†Evernia.


Pinus spp.


The origin of coniferous forests was told in the story of the woman who married a snake and later pursued her brothers who had killed the snakebeing. While the boys were fleeing southward, one of them threw √£ porcupine tail which magically created a forest that sprang up as a barrier to the woman‚Äôs detached head which rolled in hot pursuit. The woman had the special power of seeing through anything and soon spotted the boys on the other side of the forest. Meanwhile they prayed for the trees to have children and so replenish the barrier between them and certain death at the hands of the woman. The story continues with the creation of the mountains, etc.


Five variations of conifer were distinguished: ‚Äúcurly pine‚Äù (from the lichen growths on the branches of Pinus contorta), ‚Äúmean pine‚Äù (also ‚Äúsweet pine‚Äù,¬†Abies lasiocarpa), ‚Äútomato scent pine‚Äù (¬†Thuja spp.), ‚Äúred pine‚Äù (¬†Pseudotsuga menziesii?), and ‚Äúcedar pine‚Äù (¬†Juniperus spp.?).


Travois and tipi poles were made from¬†Pinus contorta¬†while the young¬†[Page 117]¬†trees furnished back-rest poles and bed supports. The back-rest poles were cut about five forearms in length and dried over a fire of rotten logs. One end of the pole was perforated and the other end sharpened. Then a stick was inserted through the hole and the pole etched. Later it was painted red and blue with buffalo shoulder-blade applicators. Back-rest poles were often notched to record the number of camp moves.


Story-sticks were prepared by older men and presented to children in return for favors. The sticks were notched to count the number of stories that the man would tell the child. They were often varnished with a solution of boiled hoof and steer phallus and sometimes red ochre was added. Then the stick was polished with a piece of rawhide. Story-sticks were sometimes used to hang tipi doors.


Wind chimes were made and presented to newly married couples. Little sticks were also prepared and notched to act as fasteners on designated foot-storage bags.


Bowls were fashioned from pine burls¬†(Fig. 35). The process was to apply grease to the burl, scrape with a rough stone, apply more grease and repeat the process until the bowl was finished. If grease was not used the bowl would crack.


The resin of¬†Pinus contorta¬†was boiled with buffalo phallus and used as a glue for headdresses and bows. It was also applied to moccasins for waterproofing.


Polyporus spp.


This fungus was often taken from the mountains (stolen occasionally from the Kooteney Indians) or detached from willows. Then it was scraped with a knife and attached to ‚ÄúWeasel-robes‚Äù when it could be used in emergency first-aid treatment. It was a styptic on wounds and boiled with¬†Psoralea¬†[Page 118]


[Page 119]¬†esculenta¬†to treat coughs. The infusion of the fungus was taken to stop diarrhea and treat dysentery.


Populus tremuloides


Whistles were made by loosening the bark of a branch replacing it and blowing through it. Another type of whistle was made by blowing through the moistened leaves.


Potentilla anserina


The runners of the plant were used to fix leggins in place. The leggings were tied above the knee and then folded over to the ankle, like a boot. Girls used the runners to tie blankets. Though the runners did not hold their strength long, they were easily replaced.


Potentilla fruticosa


The plant, a small bush, was called ‚Äúdeer seat‚Äù because the animals were often found resting in clearings where the plant was common.


Pillows were sometimes filled with the leaves.


Prunus virginiana


The straight branches were used in making back-rests¬†(Fig. 36). The hard wood, which did not burn easily, was used in making incense tongs¬†(Fig. 37)¬†and roasting skewers.


‚Äòsoralea esculenta


Pieces of the root were dried and attached to clothing and robes as ornamentation and medicine. Sometimes this root was scraped and used to replace the pieces of¬†Polyporus¬†which was attached to ‚ÄúWeasel-robes‚Äù.


Ribes aureum


The Sarsi Indians were a constant source of humor to the Blackfoot. Because they were Beaver Indians who were in the midst of adopting a plains¬†[Page 120]


[Page 122]¬†mode, they were often considered awkward and clumsy. For example, it is said that they had to be taught to put ear-flaps on their lodges so that the smoke would be controlled.


This plant received the name, ‚ÄúSarsi punctures-berry‚Äù, because while the berries looked like the ‚Äúreal punctures-berry‚Äù (¬†Ribes oxyacanthoides), they didn‚Äôt taste as good and were considered ‚Äúfakes‚Äù.


Ribes oxyacanthoides


Children played a game with the berries of this bush. They sat in a circle and began counting to ten, each child counting one number around the circle. The tenth child would take five berries and eat them at once, trying his best not to show a bitter face. If he was successful, the child next to him would do the same and this would continue until one grimaced at the sour taste. He was then struck on the thigh with a knuckle-punch, thus giving the name ‚Äúpunctured-berry‚Äù to the plant. The child who never grimaced won all the others‚Äô berry supplies.


Rubus parviflora


The berries were considered inedible and the plant named ‚Äúbear-eats-them‚Äù to denote the fact.


The berries were used to dye tanned robes. They were smeared over a new hide and dried in the sun. Then they were scraped off and the hide polished until it shone.


The berry was applied to quivers to strengthen them.


Salix spp.


A buzzing whistle was made by loosening the bark around a branch and blowing through it.


The boughs were cut and used in making back-rest slats and sweatlodge frames.


[Page 123]


Spiraea densiflora


The flowering stems were used as paint brushes, especially on the large spaces of tipis.


Thacictrum occidentalis


The fruits were kept as a household and clothing deodorant and were often crushed and mixed with paint for a robe, etc.


Thermopsis rhombifolia


The flowering of this plant signaled the time when the sponsorers of the Holy Lodge were to begin collecting buffalo tongues in preparation for the Sun Dance. It was also the time when the buffalo were fat enough for good hunting.


Arrow shafts were rubbed with the yellow petals for coloring.


Viola adunca

Acer glabrum


Small cases of the folded bark contained the grease which was mixed with ochre to make paint. A larger carrying case was made of the same material and worn under the left arm.


Allium spp.


A piece of hide was dipped in a decoction of¬†Allium¬†bulb and used to shine arrows. The bulbs were also rubbed on quivers as a deodorant.


Amelanchier alnifolia


Favors were asked while presenting a gift of four of the berries. The receiver was obliged to return the goodwill. Girls played a game whilÀúe harvesting the berries. After some berries had been gathered the girls would sit together and hold their breath while another called out ‚Äòtops, tops, tops‚Äô at a regular beat. Each girl put a berry in her bag for every call and the one who held her breath the longest won all the other girls‚Äô berries.


Anemone patens


Because the plant acted as vessicant, pranks were played on unsuspecting people who would ask someone to fetch them some toilet paper. It worked especially well at night.


Arctostaphylos uva-ursi


The dry berries were put in rattles¬†(Fig. 33). They were preferred over stones because they were lighter and didn‚Äôt make dust, a constant¬†[Page 108]


[Page 109]¬†problem during long ceremonies in which many rattles were used.


The dry berries were strung on necklaces.


This berry was the one used by the girl who escaped from the cannibal in the story of the Lost Children (Wissler,¬†Mythology of the Blackfoot Indians, p. 128).


Artemisia campestris


An infusion of the root was rubbed on a hide that was being tanned.


Artemisia frigida


For deodorant, saddles,¬†(Fig. 34)¬†womens‚Äô pillows, hide bags and quivers were stuffed with¬†Artemisia frigida¬†and¬†A. ludoviciana.


In the preparation of rattles, the skin was moulded around balls of the plant.


Paint applicators made from broken shoulder blades of buffalo or cattle were cleaned with¬†A. frigida, then dipped in another color.


Quantities of the plant were put on campfire coals and the smoke repelled mosquitoes.


Children played a game of clubbing gophers unconcious and reviving them holding the crushed leaves to the animal‚Äôs nostrils.


Hides were treated with water in which the plant had been soaked or brewed.


Aster spp.


The various color forms of this genus were thought to be the effect of aging rather than indicative of taxonomic difference. The sequence went from white to blue and finally yellow.


The Holy Woman of the Sun Dance wore a necklace of the yellow form.


Children rubbed the flowers on their bouncing arrows for color.


[Page 110]


[Page 111]


Castilleja spp.


Children rubbed the flowers on their bouncing arrows for color and shine.


Arrow feathers were dyed a light yellow by combining them with the flowers and keeping them under pressure for a few hours.


The flowers were used to shine and waterproof hides.


The color forms were considered the effect of age, the sequence moving from white to red to yellow.


Clematis verticellaris


The plant, a creeping vine, was called ‚Äúghost rope‚Äù because it covered trees and bushes in a mysterious way. The leaves were used in the removal of ‚Äúghost bullets‚Äù (supernatural objects that were shot into people by ghosts). The bullets were removed by a diviner either with a sucking tube or through a slit in the skin made by a flint. Then the leaves were boiled and applied to the place where the bullets were removed. Fainting was often the result of coming near a ghost and the victim was revived with a smudge of the stem of this plant. At night, children wore the flowers in their hair to keep ghosts away.


Cornus stolonifera


According to a certain myth there was a time when the bark of this bush was white and not red. Naapi saw some gophers playing in the warm ashes of a campfire. They would bury each other in the ashes and when it got too hot they would cry out and the others would uncover them. Naapi joined the game and persuaded them all to get in the ashes. Only a pregnant gopher resisted and Naapi let her go, saying that she was necessary to propogate the species. Then he roasted the gophers and made a frame of¬†cornus stolonifera¬†which he used as a plate while he ate them. That was how the¬†[Page 112]¬†bark turned red and to this day the grease from the gophers drips from the branches when they are heated.


When the usual wood could not be found, the stems of¬†C. stolonifera¬†were used to make pipestems and tamps.


Delphinium bicolor


The flowers were mixed in water and used to dye quills a light blue.


Elaeagnus commutata


This bush obtained the name ‚Äúexcrement smell‚Äù from the story of Naapi and the Gophers. Naapi punished his anus for failing to guard his roasted gophers from a lynx by hitting it with a branch of this plant. From that time on the wood smelled like excrement when it was burned and those who used it for firewood were chided for being lazy.


In craft, the seeds were cleaned, boiled, threaded and hung to dry. Then they were greased and made into necklaces. Sometimes the seeds were interspaced with¬†Juniperus¬†berries. Also, the bark of the bush was braided and used to whip the stone tops which children spun on the ice during winter. These whips usually lasted longer than the rawhide ones.


Epilobium angustifolium


The flowers were rubbed on rawhide thongs and mittens for waterproofing.


During the winter the powdered inner cortex was put on the hands and face to protect them from the cold. It was especially useful when the hands were uncovered for skinning, etc. When the powder was used, the hands would not hurt when they warmed up again.


Equisetum arvense


Children used the plant to shine their bouncing arrows.


The powdered stems were put in moccasins to avoid foot cramps when traveling long distances.


[Page 113]


Also, the stems¬†A¬†


(A¬†/The stems of¬†Equisetum arvense--Analyst/)





were crushed and combined with porcupine quills which had been quartered longitudinally. Both were stored under pressure in a moose bladder-bag until the quills turned a light pink.


Evernia vulpina


A yellow dye was produced from pieces of this lichen which was combined under pressure with porcupine quills.


‚ÄúFish-backbone‚Äù


The root was immersed in water which was later used to soak a green hide. Then the hide was stored for tanning.


Gaillardia aristata


The flower heads were rubbed on rawhide bags for waterproofing. Also, the flowerheads were used to absorb soups and broth and served as spoons for the sick and invalid.


Glycyrrhiza lepidota


The burrs of this plant received the name ‚ÄúTakes-a-Woman-By-Force‚Äù because, like a man to a woman, they attach themselves so readily.


It was believed that ghosts shot their victims with parts of the burr, thereby inflicting disease. If the ‚Äúmysterious bullet‚Äù was not extracted by a diviner the patient was sure to die or his face would contort and he would go dumb.


Buffalo runners kept the burrs in the mouth to protect against thirst.


Heracleum lantum


The hollow stems of the plant were made into children‚Äôs flutes. They also served as toy blowgun, with bullets furnished by choke-cherry pits. Schaeffer records a variation of the blowgun idea amongst the South Peigan. Children would cut off a section of the dry stem and plug one end with a¬†[Page 114]¬†flowerhead of ‚Äúgumweed‚Äù (probably¬†Grindelia squarrosa). The stem¬†A¬†


(A¬†/The stem of¬†Heracleum lantum--Analyst/)





was filled with water, the top end plugged in the same way and a stick was fitted into the bottom to afford a piston-like action for squirting the water out the far end. The child used his squirt-gun to kill crickets and such, after which he declared that he had ‚Äúkilled his meat‚Äù.


Infirm people would use the stems to suck soup and stew without raising up.


Hierchloe odorata


Saddles were packed with this grass (as well as sage) to keep them smelling good.

The string figures depicted myths and stories of lightning, moon, wallaby, fish, boat, canoe, crocodile, snake, spirits of the dead, and other forest spirits, to mention only a few. The myths that went with the figures were not always the same as those collected by Mountford and myself from the adults, but this is probably due to the natural distortion of children. It also appears that the stories are not being passed on to the children today as an important part of their education.

Subsistence strategy in the fish and hare period, northern Ontario: the Weagamow Ojibwa, 1880-1920",FISHING HOOK,Tended facility,Comp,NA,AdultVersion,NO,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Boys,NA,NA,NA,NA,North America,Hunter-gatherers,"Middle-aged and elderly residents of present Weagamow Lake village never failed to point out that in their youth, everyone depended on the land for their survival, lacking all but a smattering of the store goods of today, and with trapping minimal. For food, especially, they stressed their diet of fish and hare, with only an occasional kill of caribou, and moose a real rarity. And for clothing and bedding, they stressed their reliance on hare skins. Following are some extracts from accounts of their early experiences, each recounting a part of his or her own unique history. Their histories varied: some had flour when others had not seen it; caribou or moose were recalled by some, while others noted the lack of anything but fish with a respite of hare. (It should be remembered that moose re-entered the area from the south during this period, further diversifying the residents' individual recollections, depending on the part of the area in which they hunted, as well as the year of their birth.) Even when they seem to speak in general terms, these people rarely speak for others, but tell only what they ‚Äúsaw themselves.‚Äù This is characteristic of Ojibwa reporting, often stated at [Page 16] the end of the account: ‚ÄúThese things happened when I was a child. I saw them.‚Äù The following are all translated or interpreted from Ojibwa. The order of the citations is chronological, by the ages of the persons cited, placing their testimony roughly in sequence within the 40-year period:


When they had used up all their food, the people made a fishtrap at the big rapid [North Caribou Lake]. But when their fishtrap froze over there was no more fish. Nothing to eat [from an account of a nearly legendary incident, tentatively dated as 1850 or earlier].


Emma's mother [born by 1860] told me, ‚ÄúI was just a young girl, and we had nothing to eat. It was almost spring. I made an ice hole so I could fish.‚Äù


When I was small boy, at that time only live on fish. At that time no nets. Only use the hooks. And once in awhile rabbits. At that time only two kinds of food used: rabbits and fish. At that time occasionally get a caribou. No moose at that time [born about 1886].


My mother-in-law [born 1886] told me that the first flour, she couldn't eat it because it didn't taste good to her. She told me it was the first time she saw flour. She also told me the first time she saw a skirt. It was like a blanket‚Äîwool, and black. They got it from Big Trout, they went there and bought it.


Used fish most and rabbits and sometimes meat. No flour, tea, or goods. My father used to snare rabbits and trap beaver [born 1892].


As far back as I can remember, this is how everybody dressed. Nobody wore any cloth as we do today. Only rabbitskin clothing. Girls without parents were really poor. For shoes they wore rags, and for thread they would tear the canvas and take the threads out. Those who made shoes out of moosehide, for thread they would use rabbit sinew. The poorer people made shoes out of fish skin also. Snowshoes were worn in winter. And where nowadays moosehide is used [for lacings], they used to use just wood. The women also had wooden snowshoes, not the kind we wear today. That is how they dressed in the winter. In the summer they got their thread from a fish. We never had any dishes, and in the summer we used birchbark for a dish. And we also had spoons made of wood, and that is what we used when we ate. For a comb, we used a twig. My mother would wash the floor, using ash and water. And for drying the floor, she would use moss. For a broom, she would get a few branches from a tree, tie them together. We never had a wood stove, either. Clay surrounded the place where we built our fire [born by 1893].


Fish and rabbits, those were the most used. Just use hook for fish. I remember that old people in the morning went out on the lake to see if any fish caught. If not no lunch [born about 1900].


Long ago, there weren't any fishnets. Only hooks for fishing, and sticks. In winter we cut a hole in the ice, put the sticks across and sheltered the hole with branches. We stayed there and fished in the lake. That was how people fed themselves, in winter [born by 1903].

There were many of us when we were children. There were nine of us girls and six boys. We used to cook in a huge kettle and each of us would get only a bit to eat, for there were so many of us. This was when I was a child. I hardly ever had a decent meal, and never drank tea. Because the pot my father made tea in wasn't big enough for all of us [born by 1906].


My sister took care of me after my parents died. I was still in a cradleboard‚Ä¶ just a small baby. I lived on fish, for flour wasn't around then, or milk. And I used to drink fish broth in a pike's bladder. That was my bottle, and that was how they brought me up. My sister used to fish through a hole in the ice in the winter. That is how she fed me [born about 1910].


In old days only three things used: fish, rabbits, and a few moose. When short of stuff, setting snares for rabbits. In the old days didn't have flour [born about 1910].


They made a hole in the ice and used a hook to get fish. There was nothing else to eat. In the morning when they get fish they eat it. In the evening they did the same thing. They wore rabbitskin clothes to keep them warm while fishing. People long ago were very poor and had a hard time to get food for themselves [born 1913].


At that time get no food from the store. The first thing I saw was beans and rolled oats. I was about ten when first saw beans. Didn't know what it was. And then saw flour‚Ä¶ and then I was getting a little bigger and working. And with my grandfather set nets before he died [in 1930]. Used a bark canoe to do this [born 1913].


Then my mother would go out alone after food and I would be alone, when I was young. She would bring fish and that's how we ate. And that's how poor we were. Then we would catch a few rabbits again. That's my story, from my childhood. But when I was young I ate anything. Long ago it wasn't like it is today. Long ago they ate any food [born 1915].


In the past, used to eat everything. They used to take every part of the animal. Like the blood, they ate the blood, too. You put it in a small intestine‚Ä¶ make a bag of the intestine, put blood in, let it freeze. And I tasted wa.kan (tripe de roche) once. They used to eat it. When you cook it, it's nice. Boil it in a pot with water, with some fish eggs [born 1919].


Wa.kan? Yes, I ate that too. It was good. They ate it with fish. Would boil pickerel (walleye) heads, for a long time. Then put the wa.kan in, and stir. When it cools, eat the whole thing. Another way they cooked it: with rabbit liver. They collected rabbit livers, boiled them, mashed them, then put wa.kan in. When there were stores at Osnaburgh and Trout, and when people from here walked there, in winter, they would take along some rabbit liver. And on the way they'd pick the wa.kan, and when they camped they cooked it. Also, along the way, sometimes they'd see partridges. At that time there wasn't any flour. None of the foods we have today. Just fish, partridges, a little bit of rabbits [born 1919].


The first store they heard of was at Osnaburgh House. Later heard of Trout Lake. And all over they had no store food, sugar, flour, or tea. And when my grandfather [born about 1860] went to Osnaburgh House and found [Page 18] flour and tea, he didn't know what it was. Since that time more and more [trade goods] they have been getting [born 1919].",NA,NA,https://ehrafworldcultures.yale.edu/sres/864a9bed-8680-4cfb-8085-1be53dae6ff6,47.33,-91.86,1976,10482,Use,Single

Though quite young, she had even then become a sacred woman, one of the women who, every summer, build a great lodge to give to Sun. Dearly my father and mother loved me, and I loved them. As soon as I could walk, my mother furnished me with soft, beaded, deer leather clothes for summer, furs for winter. And my father gave me little bows and arrows and taught me to ride gentle horses; gave me six horses when I was in my sixth winter. Four of them were mares, so I was soon having quite a band of horses of my own. I loved to play with the boys, and I loved to sit before the evening lodge fires listening to the warriors and hunters telling of their brave deeds‚Äîthe old men telling of the power and goodness of Sun and all the other gods.",NA,NA,https://ehrafworldcultures.yale.edu/sres/582b7b9f-20f0-4dc4-8991-7ca0b0f29710,49.34,-111.21,1962,6278,NA,NA

Nevertheless some of their games were quite rough-and-tumble. In one such game, girls formed a circle, each pinching the flesh on the back of her neighbor's left hand; while standing thus they sang a song which was repeated as many times as necessary until someone let go of her neighbor's hand; whereupon this girl was jumped on and mauled by all the others. In another game, one girl, with her eyes closed, would try to find the others who were seated in a row on the ground. Different ones would call out: ‚ÄúThis way!

I described the children's relationship in this way:


From this world the children are divided completely by a very simple fact: they own no property. They have neither debtors nor creditors, dog's teeth nor pigs. They haven't a stick of tobacco staked in the transaction. True, the exchange may be made in the name of one of them. Kilipak's father may be paying twelve thousand dog's teeth to his cousin, the father of Kilipak's future wife. This brings the question of Kilipak's one-day marriage before the minds of the other children. They chaff him a little, suddenly stop using his personal name and call him instead ‚Äúgrandson of Nate,‚Äù the name of his bride's grandfather. Kilipak turns hot and sullen under their teasing but he takes no extra interest in the ceremony, although in the name of it his elders will some day bring him [Page 111] to account. Today he simply goes off fishing with the other boys.


Afterwards Kilipak will feel this payment in which he takes no interest: henceforth he must avoid his bride's name and the names of all her relatives, and he must lie hidden if his canoe goes through her village. So to the child's eyes, the elders have a great economic show which takes up all their time and attention, makes mother cross and father absentminded, makes the food supply in the house less subject to the child's insistent demands, takes the whole family away from home, or separates him from the large pig which he used to enjoy riding in the water. Then there is a great deal of beating of drums, speech making, and dancing. Every ceremony is just like every other. It may be of huge interest to his elders that for a kinekin feast for a pregnant woman the packs of sago are stacked in threes, while for a pinpuaro feast after birth the sago packs are stood upright. To the elder such important bits of ceremonial procedure are sign and symbol of intimate knowledge, like the inside knowledge on the stock market which the new speculator displays so proudly. But to the child as to the non-investor, this is all so much unintelligible rigmarole.


His version of the whole spectacle is brief and concise. There are two kinds of payments‚Äîthe payments made on a grand scale and the small gradual repayments made individually. The big ones may be canoes of sago and pigs and oil, or they may be hundreds of dog's teeth hung up on the islet, in which case there may be dancing. Sometimes, for wholly inexplicable reasons, there is no dancing. At other times a pig changes hands and a drum is beaten about that, most annoyingly. The drum beat may turn one from one's play in anticipation of some interesting event. And it turns out to be nothing but the payment of a debt. Afterwards there are always quarrels, insults, and recriminations. If mother is very much involved in the transaction, so involved that it would be inconvenient to go home‚Äîin the children's words, if mother ‚Äúhas work‚Äù‚Äîfather will be especially nasty to her, knowing she won't dare [Page 112] leave him. But if it's ‚Äúfather's work,‚Äù mother is likely to be extra disagreeable, to weary of it in the middle, and go off to her own kin. The fact that a lot of this ‚Äúwork‚Äù is ostensibly in his name only serves to set the child more firmly against it, as a most incomprehensible nuisance. To all questions about commerce, the children answer furiously: ‚ÄúHow should we know‚Äîwho's grown up here anyway, we or you? What do you think you are to bother us about such things! It's your business, not ours.‚Äù


The parents permit their children to remain in this happy state of irresponsible inattention. No attempt is made to give the children property and enlist their interest in the financial game. They are simply expected to respect the tabus and avoidances which flow from the economic arrangements, because failure to do so will anger the spirits and produce undesirable results.


In the child's world, property, far from being garnered and stored, is practically communal in use if not in ownership. Property consists of small canoes, paddles, punts, bows and arrows, spears, spider-web nets, strings of beads, occasional bits of tobacco or betel nuts. These last are always shared freely among the children. One poor little cigarette of newspaper and Louisiana twist trade tobacco will pass through fifteen hands before it is returned to its owner for a final farewell puff. If among a group of children one name is heard shouted very frequently above the rest, the listener can be sure that that child has a cigarette which the others are begging. Similarly a string of beads will pass from child to child as a free gift for which no return is expected. Quarrels over property are the rule in the adult world, but they are not frequent among children. The older children imitate their parents' severity and chastise younger children for even touching adults' property, but this is more for a chance to start a fight and from force of habit than from any keen interest in protecting the property.


Quarrels which spring up from other causes will be justified in terms of property, if an adult inquires into them. The children [Page 113] know that to say ‚ÄúHe took my canoe‚Äù will elicit more sympathy than ‚ÄúI wanted to make cat's cradles and he didn't‚Äù; and the child is an adept at translating his world into terms which are acceptable to the adult.


The constant buying and selling, advance and repayment in the adult world is a serious obstacle to any co-operative effort. Individually owned wealth is a continual spur to self-centred individualistic activity. But among the children, where there are no such individual stakes, much more co-operation is seen. The boys of fourteen and fifteen who stand at the head of the group organize the younger children, plan races, on foot or in canoe, organize football teams, the football being a lemon; or institute journeys to the river for a swim. Surface quarrelling and cuffing is fairly frequent, but there is little permanent ill humour. The leadership is too spontaneous, too informal, and has developed no strong devices for coercing the unwilling. The recalcitrant goes home unchastised, the trouble-maker remains. The older boys scold and indulge in vivid vituperation but they dare not use any appreciable force. A real fight between children, even very tiny ones, means a quarrel between their parents, and in any case the child always finds a sympathizer in his parents. Irritation over missped plans or a spoiled game takes itself out, very much as dominoes fall down one upon another. Yesa tells Bopau to get his canoe. Bopau refuses. Yesa slaps him, Tchokal slaps Yesa for slapping Bopau and Kilipak slaps Tchokal for slapping Yesa. Kilipak being the largest in that group, the scuffle degenerates into a few wailing or sulking individuals. In five minutes all is fair weather again unless some child feels so affronted that he goes home to find sympathy. These teapot tempests are frequent and unimportant, the consequence of a large number of aggressive children playing together without devices for control. At that, they are far sunnier and less quarrelsome than their elders, more amenable to leadership, friendlier, less suspicious and more generous. Deep-rooted feuds and antagonisms are absent. Among the elders almost every person has definite antagonisms, always smouldering, always likely [Page 114] to break out into open quarrels. But the size and the varying ages of the children make a fluid unpatterned grouping in which close personal attachments and special antagonisms do not flourish.


Although the parents take violent part for their children, their children do not reciprocate. Children whose parents are making the village ring with abuse, will placidly continue their games in the moonlight. If the quarrels between the parents grow so serious that the spirits may be expected to take a hand, the children are warned against going to the house of the enemy, a prohibition which they may or may not obey.


The whole convention of the child's world is thus a play convention. All participation is volitional and without an arri`re pens√©e. But among the adults casual friendliness, neighbourly visiting is regarded as almost reprehensible. Young men without position or standing go to the houses of older relatives to ask for assistance or to render services. Men may haunt their sisters' homes. But visiting between men of the same status, or between married women who are neither sisters nor sisters-in-law, is regarded as trifling, undignified behaviour.",NA,NA,https://ehrafworldcultures.yale.edu/sres/d3753b67-9f6e-4443-a0db-1755a0909f33,-2.17,147.17,1956,2626,NA,NA

I described the children's relationship in this way:


From this world the children are divided completely by a very simple fact: they own no property. They have neither debtors nor creditors, dog's teeth nor pigs. They haven't a stick of tobacco staked in the transaction. True, the exchange may be made in the name of one of them. Kilipak's father may be paying twelve thousand dog's teeth to his cousin, the father of Kilipak's future wife. This brings the question of Kilipak's one-day marriage before the minds of the other children. They chaff him a little, suddenly stop using his personal name and call him instead ‚Äúgrandson of Nate,‚Äù the name of his bride's grandfather. Kilipak turns hot and sullen under their teasing but he takes no extra interest in the ceremony, although in the name of it his elders will some day bring him [Page 111] to account. Today he simply goes off fishing with the other boys.


Afterwards Kilipak will feel this payment in which he takes no interest: henceforth he must avoid his bride's name and the names of all her relatives, and he must lie hidden if his canoe goes through her village. So to the child's eyes, the elders have a great economic show which takes up all their time and attention, makes mother cross and father absentminded, makes the food supply in the house less subject to the child's insistent demands, takes the whole family away from home, or separates him from the large pig which he used to enjoy riding in the water. Then there is a great deal of beating of drums, speech making, and dancing. Every ceremony is just like every other. It may be of huge interest to his elders that for a kinekin feast for a pregnant woman the packs of sago are stacked in threes, while for a pinpuaro feast after birth the sago packs are stood upright. To the elder such important bits of ceremonial procedure are sign and symbol of intimate knowledge, like the inside knowledge on the stock market which the new speculator displays so proudly. But to the child as to the non-investor, this is all so much unintelligible rigmarole.


His version of the whole spectacle is brief and concise. There are two kinds of payments‚Äîthe payments made on a grand scale and the small gradual repayments made individually. The big ones may be canoes of sago and pigs and oil, or they may be hundreds of dog's teeth hung up on the islet, in which case there may be dancing. Sometimes, for wholly inexplicable reasons, there is no dancing. At other times a pig changes hands and a drum is beaten about that, most annoyingly. The drum beat may turn one from one's play in anticipation of some interesting event. And it turns out to be nothing but the payment of a debt. Afterwards there are always quarrels, insults, and recriminations. If mother is very much involved in the transaction, so involved that it would be inconvenient to go home‚Äîin the children's words, if mother ‚Äúhas work‚Äù‚Äîfather will be especially nasty to her, knowing she won't dare [Page 112] leave him. But if it's ‚Äúfather's work,‚Äù mother is likely to be extra disagreeable, to weary of it in the middle, and go off to her own kin. The fact that a lot of this ‚Äúwork‚Äù is ostensibly in his name only serves to set the child more firmly against it, as a most incomprehensible nuisance. To all questions about commerce, the children answer furiously: ‚ÄúHow should we know‚Äîwho's grown up here anyway, we or you? What do you think you are to bother us about such things! It's your business, not ours.‚Äù


The parents permit their children to remain in this happy state of irresponsible inattention. No attempt is made to give the children property and enlist their interest in the financial game. They are simply expected to respect the tabus and avoidances which flow from the economic arrangements, because failure to do so will anger the spirits and produce undesirable results.


In the child's world, property, far from being garnered and stored, is practically communal in use if not in ownership. Property consists of small canoes, paddles, punts, bows and arrows, spears, spider-web nets, strings of beads, occasional bits of tobacco or betel nuts. These last are always shared freely among the children. One poor little cigarette of newspaper and Louisiana twist trade tobacco will pass through fifteen hands before it is returned to its owner for a final farewell puff. If among a group of children one name is heard shouted very frequently above the rest, the listener can be sure that that child has a cigarette which the others are begging. Similarly a string of beads will pass from child to child as a free gift for which no return is expected. Quarrels over property are the rule in the adult world, but they are not frequent among children. The older children imitate their parents' severity and chastise younger children for even touching adults' property, but this is more for a chance to start a fight and from force of habit than from any keen interest in protecting the property.


Quarrels which spring up from other causes will be justified in terms of property, if an adult inquires into them. The children [Page 113] know that to say ‚ÄúHe took my canoe‚Äù will elicit more sympathy than ‚ÄúI wanted to make cat's cradles and he didn't‚Äù; and the child is an adept at translating his world into terms which are acceptable to the adult.


The constant buying and selling, advance and repayment in the adult world is a serious obstacle to any co-operative effort. Individually owned wealth is a continual spur to self-centred individualistic activity. But among the children, where there are no such individual stakes, much more co-operation is seen. The boys of fourteen and fifteen who stand at the head of the group organize the younger children, plan races, on foot or in canoe, organize football teams, the football being a lemon; or institute journeys to the river for a swim. Surface quarrelling and cuffing is fairly frequent, but there is little permanent ill humour. The leadership is too spontaneous, too informal, and has developed no strong devices for coercing the unwilling. The recalcitrant goes home unchastised, the trouble-maker remains. The older boys scold and indulge in vivid vituperation but they dare not use any appreciable force. A real fight between children, even very tiny ones, means a quarrel between their parents, and in any case the child always finds a sympathizer in his parents. Irritation over missped plans or a spoiled game takes itself out, very much as dominoes fall down one upon another. Yesa tells Bopau to get his canoe. Bopau refuses. Yesa slaps him, Tchokal slaps Yesa for slapping Bopau and Kilipak slaps Tchokal for slapping Yesa. Kilipak being the largest in that group, the scuffle degenerates into a few wailing or sulking individuals. In five minutes all is fair weather again unless some child feels so affronted that he goes home to find sympathy. These teapot tempests are frequent and unimportant, the consequence of a large number of aggressive children playing together without devices for control. At that, they are far sunnier and less quarrelsome than their elders, more amenable to leadership, friendlier, less suspicious and more generous. Deep-rooted feuds and antagonisms are absent. Among the elders almost every person has definite antagonisms, always smouldering, always likely [Page 114] to break out into open quarrels. But the size and the varying ages of the children make a fluid unpatterned grouping in which close personal attachments and special antagonisms do not flourish.

Individually owned wealth is a continual spur to self-centred individualistic activity. But among the children, where there are no such individual stakes, much more co-operation is seen. The boys of fourteen and fifteen who stand at the head of the group organize the younger children, plan races, on foot or in canoe, organize football teams, the football being a lemon; or institute journeys to the river for a swim. Surface quarrelling and cuffing is fairly frequent, but there is little permanent ill humour. The leadership is too spontaneous, too informal, and has developed no strong devices for coercing the unwilling. The recalcitrant goes home unchastised, the trouble-maker remains. The older boys scold and indulge in vivid vituperation but they dare not use any appreciable force. A real fight between children, even very tiny ones, means a quarrel between their parents, and in any case the child always finds a sympathizer in his parents. Irritation over missped plans or a spoiled game takes itself out, very much as dominoes fall down one upon another. Yesa tells Bopau to get his canoe. Bopau refuses. Yesa slaps him, Tchokal slaps Yesa for slapping Bopau and Kilipak slaps Tchokal for slapping Yesa. Kilipak being the largest in that group, the scuffle degenerates into a few wailing or sulking individuals. In five minutes all is fair weather again unless some child feels so affronted that he goes home to find sympathy. These teapot tempests are frequent and unimportant, the consequence of a large number of aggressive children playing together without devices for control. At that, they are far sunnier and less quarrelsome than their elders, more amenable to leadership, friendlier, less suspicious and more generous. Deep-rooted feuds and antagonisms are absent. Among the elders almost every person has definite antagonisms, always smouldering, always likely [Page 114] to break out into open quarrels. But the size and the varying ages of the children make a fluid unpatterned grouping in which close personal attachments and special antagonisms do not flourish.


Although the parents take violent part for their children, their children do not reciprocate. Children whose parents are making the village ring with abuse, will placidly continue their games in the moonlight. If the quarrels between the parents grow so serious that the spirits may be expected to take a hand, the children are warned against going to the house of the enemy, a prohibition which they may or may not obey.


The whole convention of the child's world is thus a play convention. All participation is volitional and without an arri`re pens√©e. But among the adults casual friendliness, neighbourly visiting is regarded as almost reprehensible. Young men without position or standing go to the houses of older relatives to ask for assistance or to render services. Men may haunt their sisters' homes. But visiting between men of the same status, or between married women who are neither sisters nor sisters-in-law, is regarded as trifling, undignified behaviour.",NA,NA,https://ehrafworldcultures.yale.edu/sres/d3753b67-9f6e-4443-a0db-1755a0909f33,-2.17,147.17,1956,2626,NA,NA

New lives for old: cultural transformation--Manus, 1928-1953",UKNOWN (SPIDER-WEB NET),Tended facility,Simple,NA,AdultVersion,NO,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Unknown,NA,NA,NA,NA,Oceania,Hunter-gatherers,"The adult world was a world of continual economic activity and angry driving tension. I described the children's relationship in this way:


From this world the children are divided completely by a very simple fact: they own no property. They have neither debtors nor creditors, dog's teeth nor pigs. They haven't a stick of tobacco staked in the transaction. True, the exchange may be made in the name of one of them. Kilipak's father may be paying twelve thousand dog's teeth to his cousin, the father of Kilipak's future wife. This brings the question of Kilipak's one-day marriage before the minds of the other children. They chaff him a little, suddenly stop using his personal name and call him instead ‚Äúgrandson of Nate,‚Äù the name of his bride's grandfather. Kilipak turns hot and sullen under their teasing but he takes no extra interest in the ceremony, although in the name of it his elders will some day bring him [Page 111] to account. Today he simply goes off fishing with the other boys.


Afterwards Kilipak will feel this payment in which he takes no interest: henceforth he must avoid his bride's name and the names of all her relatives, and he must lie hidden if his canoe goes through her village. So to the child's eyes, the elders have a great economic show which takes up all their time and attention, makes mother cross and father absentminded, makes the food supply in the house less subject to the child's insistent demands, takes the whole family away from home, or separates him from the large pig which he used to enjoy riding in the water. Then there is a great deal of beating of drums, speech making, and dancing. Every ceremony is just like every other. It may be of huge interest to his elders that for a kinekin feast for a pregnant woman the packs of sago are stacked in threes, while for a pinpuaro feast after birth the sago packs are stood upright. To the elder such important bits of ceremonial procedure are sign and symbol of intimate knowledge, like the inside knowledge on the stock market which the new speculator displays so proudly. But to the child as to the non-investor, this is all so much unintelligible rigmarole.


His version of the whole spectacle is brief and concise. There are two kinds of payments‚Äîthe payments made on a grand scale and the small gradual repayments made individually. The big ones may be canoes of sago and pigs and oil, or they may be hundreds of dog's teeth hung up on the islet, in which case there may be dancing. Sometimes, for wholly inexplicable reasons, there is no dancing. At other times a pig changes hands and a drum is beaten about that, most annoyingly. The drum beat may turn one from one's play in anticipation of some interesting event. And it turns out to be nothing but the payment of a debt. Afterwards there are always quarrels, insults, and recriminations. If mother is very much involved in the transaction, so involved that it would be inconvenient to go home‚Äîin the children's words, if mother ‚Äúhas work‚Äù‚Äîfather will be especially nasty to her, knowing she won't dare [Page 112] leave him. But if it's ‚Äúfather's work,‚Äù mother is likely to be extra disagreeable, to weary of it in the middle, and go off to her own kin. The fact that a lot of this ‚Äúwork‚Äù is ostensibly in his name only serves to set the child more firmly against it, as a most incomprehensible nuisance. To all questions about commerce, the children answer furiously: ‚ÄúHow should we know‚Äîwho's grown up here anyway, we or you? What do you think you are to bother us about such things! It's your business, not ours.‚Äù


The parents permit their children to remain in this happy state of irresponsible inattention. No attempt is made to give the children property and enlist their interest in the financial game. They are simply expected to respect the tabus and avoidances which flow from the economic arrangements, because failure to do so will anger the spirits and produce undesirable results.


In the child's world, property, far from being garnered and stored, is practically communal in use if not in ownership. Property consists of small canoes, paddles, punts, bows and arrows, spears, spider-web nets, strings of beads, occasional bits of tobacco or betel nuts. These last are always shared freely among the children. One poor little cigarette of newspaper and Louisiana twist trade tobacco will pass through fifteen hands before it is returned to its owner for a final farewell puff. If among a group of children one name is heard shouted very frequently above the rest, the listener can be sure that that child has a cigarette which the others are begging. Similarly a string of beads will pass from child to child as a free gift for which no return is expected. Quarrels over property are the rule in the adult world, but they are not frequent among children. The older children imitate their parents' severity and chastise younger children for even touching adults' property, but this is more for a chance to start a fight and from force of habit than from any keen interest in protecting the property.


Quarrels which spring up from other causes will be justified in terms of property, if an adult inquires into them. The children [Page 113] know that to say ‚ÄúHe took my canoe‚Äù will elicit more sympathy than ‚ÄúI wanted to make cat's cradles and he didn't‚Äù; and the child is an adept at translating his world into terms which are acceptable to the adult.

Individually owned wealth is a continual spur to self-centred individualistic activity. But among the children, where there are no such individual stakes, much more co-operation is seen.

An aristocrat was called peŒ≥erk and referred to in English as ‚Äúa man‚Äù or ‚Äúa real man‚Äù (Kroeber 1925:40, 1960:322). A knowledgeable informant of the late 1960s suggested [Page 142] that all such peŒ≥erk had undergone ‚Äútraining‚Äù and had ultimately, under sponsorship, gone through a vision experience. For some, this experience occurred in the mountains (Spott and Kroeber 1942:168; Kroeber 1957:205); for others, the vision came while swimming, either in a lake or in whirlpools in the river or ocean (Spott and Kroeber 1942:158‚Äì159). Data on these aspects of Yurok aristocracy are frustratingly meager. It seems that an elderly male aristocrat chose for his trainee an intelligent, earnest, and responsible boy of about six. He first taught him how to make a bow, then how to make an arrow, and how to chip stone arrowheads. By the age of about eight, the novice had begun joining his sponsor in his sweathouse. He was taught by his sponsor the details of Yurok law and case precedent over the next decade. His sponsor urged him to learn, not only from him, but also from other peŒ≥erk and women who had undergone special training. The young man went into training, carrying sweathouse firewood, and praying and crying for success in his future. At the age of 16, when his sponsor felt the student's physical strength adequate, the student went through the ‚Äútest,‚Äù in which he survived a lengthly isolation in the high mountains or his swimming feat and returned with a vision. Shortly there-after, he might act as an assistant in a ceremony. Remaining in a ceremonially pure state required sweating and sexual abstinence. Many peŒ≥erk were not active in ceremonial affairs between their teens and middle age. Regular sweating and actively being a peŒ≥erk formerly were synonymous (cf. Spott and Kroeber 1942:168‚Äì170).",NA,NA,https://ehrafworldcultures.yale.edu/sres/b911f110-8e2c-488d-9672-fdb185591d12,41.5,-124,1978,1238,Use,Single

headbands [II.G.3.b.(1)]. The last time the novices sing (Plate 41 c), these headbands are collected and the tail feathers (Plate 41 d) given to the Pr√≥-kh√£mm√£. The Pr√≥-kh√£mm√£ choose a novice for excellence in the festival performance to whom they award the right to wear the warbonnet. This youth's naming-uncle is then summoned and given the feathers to make the bonnet. The headband strap and the tassel at the end are made of cotton. If the bonnet is made on time, the runner with the ceremonial lance will wear it while he runs the gauntlet of padded arrows [II.F.2.c.(3)] on the last morning of the Kh√™√™t√∫way√™ festival. He dashes up a radial pathway, and runs quickly with the warbonnet (and ceremonial lance) across a portion of the plaza.

One uses a defective arrow shaft broken off at the top and puts a knoblike attachment on it. This is a tiny patch of leather into which some wool is stuffed, while one ties it to the tip of the shaft (III. 36). In size it is about the same as the last joint of the little finger.

The fragments of the cones left by squirrels and chipmunks were gathered and pulverized into a fine powder. Backfat and marrow were added and the mixture allowed to cool until it was solid. Then it was distributed as a confection during social gatherings and meetings. It was an aid to digestion as well as a delicacy.


Acer glabrum


The dry, crushed leaves were used to spice stored meat.


Achillea millefolium


A pleasant tea was made from the leaves and flowers.


Allium spp.


A few bulbs were used to spice soup made of wheat and marrow.


Amelanchier alnifolia


The saskatoon berry was a staple food. Its most common use was in the preparation of pemmican, a mixture of animal fat, dried meat, and the crushed berry. The berries could also be combined with an equal amount of fat and stuffed into a portion of intestine which was tied at both ends and boiled, later to be eaten like a sausage. Saskatoon and Red Osier Dogwood (Cornus stolonifera) berries were a favorite snack reserved for men. Saskatoons were sometimes crushed with flour in preparation for winter storage.


For food reserves, the berries were dried on a raised hide that had numerous holes punctured in it. The hide was kept four or five feet from the ground to discourage children and animals from eating the berries. When it was dry, the choice of the harvest was greased with backfat and stored [Page 101] in hide bags made of fetal deer of sheep. That way the berries would not spoil. Then they would be added to soups or made into sausages.


Saskatoon leaves were crushed and mixed with blood, then dried and used to make a rich broth in winter.


The Blackfoot distinguished differences among river, coulee (cutbank) and mountain saskatoons and preferred the taste of the coulee one.


Arctostaphylos uva-ursi


The tart berries were washed and eaten or dried and soaked later with sugar.


The leaves could be crushed and smoked with tobacco or brewed for tea.


Artemisia campestris


Runners chewed the leaves for their mentholating properties.


Artemisia frigida


The crushed leaves were mixed with stored meat to maintain a good odor.


Artemisia ludoviciana


The leaves were chewed as a confection.


Asclepias viridiflora


In the spring the plant was used to spice soups. The fresh root was often eaten and pieces saved for winter soups.


Astragalus canadensis


The root, known as ‚ÄúTender Root‚Äù, was another staple and was either eaten fresh or boiled in blood or broth. Sometimes the roots were obtained by robbing the burrow of a small, mouse-like mammal.


Berberis repens


On rare occasions the berry was eaten when nothing else was available.


Cammassia quamash


The bulbs were boiled and given in soup on special events. The [Page 102] Blackfoot always obtained them from the Kootenay and called them ‚Äúexcrements‚Äù, the same name for candy.


Cirsium spp.


The flower head was dissected and the pedicel eaten fresh.


Cornus stolonifera


The cambium of the dogwood was dried, greased and crushed, then mixed with smoking tobacco.


The ripe berries were eaten.


Crataegus chrysocarpa


Certain conditions had to be met before the berries were eaten. Otherwise, they would cause stomach cramps. The procedure was to offer the tree a gift, for boys a little bow and arrow made from the thorns, for girls a pair of miniature moccasins fashioned from the leaves. In return, the tree would not allow its berries to ‚Äúbite‚Äù the stomach. The gifts were placed on the tree and the berries collected.


Disporum trachycarpum


The ripe berries of the ‚Äúdog-foot‚Äù were eaten anytime.


Elaeagnus commutata


The berries were peeled and eaten or mixed with grease and stored in a cool place, then eaten as a confection or added to soups and broths.


Epilobium angustifolium


The fresh roots of ‚Äúred round object‚Äù were eaten.


Erythronium grandiflorum


See Lilium philadelphicum


Fritillaria pudica


See Lilium philadelphicum


[Page 103]


Geranium viscosissimum


The leaves, which are quite pungent, were kept in food storage bags in order to mask the spoiling of their contents.


Heracleum lanatum


The stem of the young plant was peeled and eaten like celery. Women cut the stem into small pieces which were dipped in blood and stored until their use in soup and broths.


Lilium philadelphicum


As with Erythronium and Fritillaria, the bulb was eaten fresh or with soup. The bulb of this plant (and by association the other two) is referred to as ‚Äúbee‚Äôs tooth‚Äù because it breaks into small, rice-like kernals when it is rubbed, imaginary bee teeth.


Lomatium triternatum


The flowers of ‚Äústands alone‚Äù or ‚Äúmany standing‚Äù were sometimes mixed with pemmican.


Mammilaria vivipara


The fruits of these ‚Äúwild figs‚Äù were eaten as a confection.


Mentha arvensis


The plant was bound in bunches, dried and used to make a delicious tea of spice pemmican and soups.


Osmorhiza occidentalis


The root of ‚Äúsmell mouth‚Äù, which is quite sweet, was chewed as a confection, especially during the winter.


Perideridia gairdneri


The roots of ‚Äúdouble turnip‚Äù, another staple, were eaten fresh or saved for use in soups, etc. Children often made snacks of them while playing on the prairie.


[Page 104]


Physaria didymocarpa


A person who had not eaten for a long time would drink a decoction of the plant slowly. This would expand his stomach gradually until he could eat a normal amount without pain.


Pinus contorta


The pitch was chewed like gum.


Populus tremuloides


The cambium of aspen was eaten. Children especially would snack on it. Anyone observing a liquid taboo was allowed to suck a piece of the bark.


Potentilla fruticosa


The leaves were mixed with dried meat as a deodorant and spice.


Prunus virginiana


Women collected the ripe berries, another staple, and divided them into those to be preserved whole and those to be crushed. The ones for storage were greased and dried in the sun, then put away in the fawn-skin bags. The others were crushed on a stone and mixed with backfat for pemmican or added to soups, etc. The juice from the crushing was given as a special drink to husbands or the favorite child.


Choke-cherry sticks were gathered, stripped of their bark and inserted into raosting meat for spice.


Psoralea esculenta


Women dug the root with choke-cherry sticks. Then it was either peeled and eaten fresh or dried and added to winter supplies.


Ribes oxyacanthoides


‚ÄúPunctured berries‚Äù, a wild currant, were eaten fresh or added to soups, etc. They were not saved for winter use.


[Page 105]


Rosa spp.


Rose hips, termed ‚Äúwild tomatoes‚Äù, could be crushed and added to pemmican.


Rubus parviflorus


The ripe fruit of this ‚Äúred berry tasts‚Äù was eaten.


Salix spp.


The cambium was scraped and eaten, especially by children. The galls on some river willows were peeled and eaten and were said to be quite tasty.


Selaginella densa


A starving man would not eat the plant because it had a doping effect, making one feel unusually strong. For this apparent effect, the plant was called ‚Äúfeels chest‚Äù. The plant was also dried and used to spice meat. ‚ÄúNamanokchi‚Äù (Shepherdia argentea?)


The berries, which were very bitter, were eaten only through necessity and never stored.


Shepherdia candensis


Even though they were bitter, the berries were eaten in lean times.


Thalictrum occidentalis


The fruit of ‚ÄúGros Ventre smell‚Äù were used to spice pemmican, dried meat and broths.


Veratrum viride


The young leaves of ‚Äúbitter tastes‚Äù or ‚Äúblue leaves‚Äù were added to soups. Children were given the leaves to chew and they would stop their drooling.


‚ÄúYellow berries‚Äù


These berries were collected along the coulees and eaten fresh.",NA,NA,https://ehrafworldcultures.yale.edu/sres/e8f0807f-73bf-481d-b844-71363b9c27e9,49.34,-111.21,1974,6278,Use,Single

These seem to have no ceremonial or religious significance; they are made for recreation only, and it was found easy to learn a number while paving the way for other kinds of research. In fact, interest in them was one of the ways in which the writer became friends with a number of Bella Coola. As is to be expected, some individuals are more proficient in constructing complicated string figures than others, the old women being particularly adept. During the long delays which occur in all the dances it is a common sight to see an old crone teaching a group of young girls the figures which she herself learnt when young. Some men remember a number from childhood, but the making of designs with string is regarded as more fitting for girls and women. Songs accompany many of the figures, and the singing of these is considered an essential part of the construction. It was stated that many more figures were known long ago; in fact, several of those here recorded were only obtained after repeated efforts on the part of an old woman to reconstruct those which she had been shown when a child. No attempt was made to learn all the Bella Coola figures; a larger number could doubtless have been collected, but those here described are the ones most commonly made.",NA,NA,https://ehrafworldcultures.yale.edu/sres/6aee8b90-0fa4-4e9e-ac16-5df259daaf08,52.33,-126.5,1948,1685,Play,Single

For smaller game, a blunt arrow,‚Äô short in proportion to the comparatively great length of the bow was employed. These are still used by the boys. The arrow is not feathered nor is the nock flattened. The head of the arrow is blunt and terminates in a small point or nipple, though it is occasionally left round. The bowstring was formerly made of rawhide, but twisted commercial string now takes its place.

Parents are never seen punishing their children for disobedience or faults committed. This is partly due to the fact that the sense of what is proper and permissible is not developed among the Indians in the same way as in civilized societies. The Indian hates restraint and fetters of any kind, he wants to be free and independent himself and grants his children the same liberty. The latter, on the other hand, from an Indian point of view very seldom appear punishable, since they easily accommodate themselves to the customs and moral views of the tribe. An Indian boy may rob or do some other harm to a stranger, be he an Indian of a foreign tribe or a white man, but he will, from a natural instinct, respect the property of a¬†[Page 81]





[Page 82]¬†member of his own tribe. In the training of the Indian children the power of example and the natural desire to imitate has the most effect. It is interesting to note how the young boys constantly watch the occupations of the elder men and how easily in this way they acquire the necessary skill in the same occupations, above all in fishing and hunting. When the Toba boy is about six or seven years old, his father makes him a small bow and arrows with which he frequently practises shooting, thus at an early age acquiring dexterity in managing the weapon. Similarly the girls follow their mothers everywhere, down to the river, to the fields, and the forest, keenly watching how she does her work and soon learning to do the same.

Moving camp. During the rainy season, ‚â† Kade campsites are determined by the waterholes that accumulate in pans and molapo. Otherwise, the timing and destination of a camp move are determined by the availability of vegetable foods. Their yearly peregrinations take the San an average of 300 km2.


2. Rock painting of an eland dance. A large number of rock paintings, drawings, and engravings, believed to have been done by the San over a period of several thousand years, are found in South Africa, Namibia, and Zimbabwe but not in the Kalahari where no rocks exist to serve as ‚Äúcanvases.‚Äù This painting is from Namibia.


3. Eland dance. This dance celebrates a girl's first menstruation. The women of the camp dance in a circle around the hut where the girl lies. The fleshy eland, its abundant haunches symbolic of fertility and easy delivery, represents the San ideal female type.


4. Gemsbok dance. This dance, which involves the whole camp over several hours, is performed after a successful hunt. The women sit around a fire and sing and clap their hands, while the men dance around them, stamping the earth vigorously.


5. Gemsbok dance. As the dance reaches a peak of excitement, some dancers fall in a trancelike state.


6. Women filling ostrich egg-shell containers with water. Standing water is available from 30 to 60 days out of a year. A heavy downpour during the rainy season will leave pools of water in depressions in pans and molapo. For the remainder of the year, the San must rely on vegetables for their source of water.


7. Women cooking melon in camp. Melons are stewed in iron pans, but when these are not available, the melons are buried in hot embers or ashes. When the melon is cooked through, the rind is discarded and the rest ground in a mortar and eaten as gruel.


8. A girl digging for Cucumis kalahariensis. Digging requires much more effort than picking, as one must sometimes dig down half a meter or more.


9. Building a hut. Usually, the men gather the wood for the framework, and the women do the actual building. Over a circular area of about 2 m in diameter, a domelike frame is made and is thatched over with tall grass growing nearby. The women work on the huts a little each day so that it takes four to five days for a hut to be completed.


10. A hunter aims his arrow at a weakened gemsbok. The San bow being a crude device, the hunter must approach within 20 m of his intended prey. The poison used on the arrows is extremely effective, but the hunter, after shooting the animal, returns to camp to enlist the help of others, and sets out again to track down the weakened animal and kill it.


11. Hunters carrying meat back to camp. After a night of gorging at the scene of kill, the hunters each shoulder a load of meat and return to camp.


12. A steenbok caught in a rope snare being beaten with a stick. Steenbok travel singly or in pairs and are taken by snares strung across routes that they use frequently.


13. Young boys playing with horses made of grass. While the adults hunt game and gather plants, the children stay in camp and play all day.


14. A mother and child relax in camp. San babies are nursed from two to three years and are in constant contact with their mothers who sling them under their arms.",NA,NA,https://ehrafworldcultures.yale.edu/sres/61207a88-9160-4e2c-bd44-4671d835b637,-19.83,20.58,1980,6655,Play,Single

She played every kind of game, such as the dice game (played with wild plumstones, carved, each carving differently evaluated, and the combinations of the throws differently evaluated), bone game (thrusting a bone point into certain holes punched into a trailer of deer-hide, played with one hand; each turn of the play is a matter of skill and has a fixed value), and snake-stick game (a variant of the dice game).

The boys are lined up not far from the target and must demonstrate their aim. They are praised or scolded according to their accomplishments. No less frequent are the archery contests with bow and arrow. It is part of the father's duty in training his sons to acquaint them early with the use of weapons. It is a vital necessity that they know how to handle them, and therefore this kind of practice is demanded of them when they are still boys(195)

Growing up in New Guinea: a comparative study of primitive education",CANOE,Transport,Simple,Low,AdultVersion,YES,NO,YES,NO,NO,NO,NO,NA,YES,VERTICAL,TEACHING-OPPORTUNITY PROVISONING,Boys,NA,NA,NA,NA,Oceania,Hunter-gatherers,"The next step in water proficiency is reached when the child begins to punt a large canoe. Early in the morning the village is alive with canoes in which the elders sit sedately on the centre platforms while small children of three punt the canoes which are three or four times as long as the children are tall. At first glance this procession looks like either the crudest sort of display of adult prestige or a particularly conspicuous form of child labour. The father sits in casual state, a man of five feet nine or ten, weighing a hundred and fifty pounds. The canoe is long and heavy, dug out of a solid log; the unwieldy outrigger makes it difficult to steer. At the end of the long craft, perched precariously on the thin gunwales, his tiny brown feet curved tensely to keep his hold, stands a small brown baby, manfully straining at the six foot punt in his hands. He is so small that he looks more like an unobtrusive stern ornament than like the pilot of the lumbering craft. Slowly, with a great display of energy but not too much actual progress, the canoe moves through the village, among other canoes similarly manned by the merest tots. But this is neither child labour nor idle prestige hunting on the part of the parents. It is part of the whole system by which a child is encouraged to do his physical best. The father is in a hurry. He has much work to do during the day. He may be setting off for overseas, or planning an important feast. The work of punting a canoe within the lagoon is second nature to him, easier than walking. But that his small child may feel important and [Page [p.29A]] [Page [30]] adequate to deal with the exacting water life, the father retires to the central platform and the infant pilot mans the canoe. And here again, there are no harsh words when the child steers clumsily, only a complete lack of interest. But the first sure deft stroke which guides the canoe back to its course is greeted with approval.",NA,NA,https://ehrafworldcultures.yale.edu/sres/46ce656b-8151-4238-876d-fd58bd726c61,-2.17,147.17,1930,2626,Use,Single
